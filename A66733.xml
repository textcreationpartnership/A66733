            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F this Book were ſet forth in any other Language, for Forreigners to read, I were unavoidably driven to give them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why I had put my ſelf upon ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and ſo unneceſſary an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as to extoll and commend that, whoſe worth and merit is owned by all the World, and which every where ſhines ſo brightly, that it cannot be obſcured by any, either Tongue, or Pen.</p>
                  <p>For it is very well known to them, that the Civil Law is the iſſue and product of that great and mighty State, the Roman Empire, that led ſo many Nations and people captive by their Wiſdome, as much as by their Valour; that was once the School of all Moral Honeſty and goodneſs, and the ſtage, whereon the whole variety of humane affairs was repreſented.</p>
                  <p>Neither need I tell them, that what through the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſs of that State, for which it was ordained, and what through the natural Equity that is to be read
<pb facs="tcp:100164:3"/>all along in it, and its being fitted for the general affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Laws of moſt of the Europaean Nations (who indeed all of them anciently were ſubject to the Roman Government) are but as copies drawn from that original, borrowing that luſtre of goodneſs they have, from it; and where their particular Laws faile, thither their Judicatories reſort to be ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>They cannot be ignorant, That though every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nation has ſome few Laws of their own, proper for their occaſions, government, and people; yet no where beyond the Seas is there any profeſſion or ſcience of Law, but this; nor any Law accounted the Law of Nations, but the Civil Law onely: That time, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, argument, and applying it to the ſeveral affairs of ſo many Nations where it has been uſed, has made it ſo perfect and ſo ſufficient a body to decide all caſes by, that are between party and party, and do not concern the publick government, that they ſtand in need of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Laws of their own making; and without it no Laws they can make, would ever be able to ſerve their turn.</p>
                  <p>To thoſe therefore that make ſuch continual uſe of this Law in their Courts, and who ſuffer none to ſit as Judges, nor plead at their Bars, but ſuch as have been brought up in that faculty, and who ſtrive to imploy thoſe onely in all tranſactions between themſelves and other Nations: to them, I ſay, to praiſe and applaud this Law, that is dignified by them ſo many ſeveral wayes, is ſo little needful, that it were almoſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
                  <p>But to make known to the people of this Nation to whom it is rendred now ſo contemptible, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it is in it ſelf, how rational; what a general appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb facs="tcp:100164:3"/>it has had with other Nations, and how very uſeful it may be to the publick welfare of this Nation divers wayes, it is a work ſo ſeaſonable and neceſſary, that it may be done without either Apology, Preface, or reaſon premiſed; and is no more then the preſent ſtate of things calls for.</p>
                  <p>For when it is conſidered, what an account it has been in amongſt us for many hundred years together; how many cauſes, Civil, Eccleſiaſtical, Maritime, and Military, it dealt in; how the juriſdiction thereof ran through the whole Nation; how very little it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the profeſſion of the Common-Law it ſelf, how many profeſſours and practiſers it maintained, and how much it did enrich them; what a number of ſtudents it encouraged; what coercive power it was intruſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the many Courts the employment thereof lay in: And when we ſee, that now the cauſes thereof are cantonized, and like a ſpoyl divided; ſome carried to the Courts of Common-Law, ſome to the Court of Equity, others ſent into the Countrey, ſome left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rule or regulation at all, and nothing left entire to the Civil Law; and when the ſolid reaſon of that Law is crowded out by vulgar reaſon, the profeſſours thereof ſcattered, the ſtudy thereof diſcontinued, the very Law-books for want of uſe here, all tranſported beyond ſea to other Nations, and all coercion taken away; It is ſo much worth the enquiring what the ground of this great change ſhould be, that to be ſilent thereat were great ſtupidity.</p>
                  <p>That the fall of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction might be a reaſon to ſuſpend the exerciſe of that profeſſion in ſome cauſes for a time, till it were again ſetled, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. But why it ſhould not under this preſent form of
<pb facs="tcp:100164:4"/>Government (if authority think fit) be reſtored again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as to a civil regulation of thoſe very matters under the Civil Magiſtrate, no ſatisfactory reaſon can be rendred. I am ſure, it can neither be rational, nor convenient, that they ſhould be carried from the Civil Law, which was the known, eſtabliſhed, and practiſed Law in thoſe matters, unto the conizance of thoſe, that have neither Law, nor rule, nor skill to try them; eſpecially when the ſo doing does inevitably draw after it the certain ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of that whole profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore very well worthy the moſt ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe that ſit at the Helme; That, ſince there muſt be a triall of thoſe matters ſtill, and again attending thereupon to one or other, (which is the Game every body hunts after:) <hi>Whether the Publick is more concerned, that the profit of ſuch coniſances ſhould flow into the purſes of others, no way apt or skilful, then go to the maintaining and keeping up of ſuch a learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, which this Nation cannot be without.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly, whenſoever we ſee that profeſſion laid aſide (which for the publick good, I truſt, I never ſhall) we ſhall find this Common-wealth of ours made very much inferiour and unequal to other Nations, with whom (as it is an Iſland, and now become an active one) it has and muſt have many wayes to do. In other things, as in ſtrength, riches, and alliances, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for advantage and ſuperiority with them, why ſhould we then ſuffer them to over-match us in wit, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, skill, knowledge, wiſdome, policy, reaſon, or judgment, which that learning above all other, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience together gives them?</p>
                  <p>The dealings that we may have with them, as they are not a few, but innumerable, even as many as there
<pb facs="tcp:100164:4"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100164:5"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100164:5"/>are things in the World to deal in: So ſome of them are of higheſt moment and conſequence alſo; As, <hi>Right to Kingdomes or Provinces, by Donation, last Will, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, or by Marriage; community or property of the Sea, and the rights of Fiſhing and trading there; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from Cuſtomes and other immunities granted to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Merchants; Precedency, amongst the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Princes and Republicks; Promiſes of protection and aide againſt enemies; Entertainment and harbouring of Traytors or Rebels, Interpretation of publick Leagues or National Contracts; Not admitting of Embaſſadours, or detaining them, or uſing them in any uncivil manner; Making of War, or contracting of Peace; Sending ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to our enemies, or oppreſsing our friends and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; Imbargo's, ſeizing upon our Merchants goods at land, or ſtopping our ſhips or goods at Sea; The arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of differences between Nation and Nation, frequently referred to Princes or other States; Of the force of natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contracts, and of their duration, whether they ſhall bind ſucceſſours, or die with the Princes that made them; Latitude of Territory and juriſdiction, either upon Sea or Land.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like are the tranſactions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that may be frequently agitated &amp; dealt in between us and other Nations; wherein before we fall to an open War, we chuſe to reaſon and expoſtulate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them; ſometimes we think it neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the right of our cauſe to other Nations; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to declare the ſtate of the buſineſs to our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Neither of which can be done effectually and with advantage, nor ſhall we be able to hold any ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment convincingly, if we have not the perfect knowledg of the Law of Nations and the learning of the Civil Law; which to be ſure, is the onely kind of Reaſon,
<pb facs="tcp:100164:6"/>that other Nations (knowing no other Common Law or Rule beſides it for ſuch matters) will encounter us withall.</p>
                  <p>And ſince we have ſuch great need at this time of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by Land, and Navies by Sea, to defend us from factions at home, and enemies abroad, I would put it to thoſe of the Military order, to conſider, how not onely uſefull, but neceſſary that profeſſion is for carrying on of Military buſineſs alſo, as well by ſea, as by land; &amp; that all the military diſcipline, &amp; good government that they have in their Armies, and the right which they are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to afford to their very enemies, is directed by the rules and principles of that profeſſion: for it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the Municipal Law, as to the carrying on of Martial affairs, is altogether impertinent, and of no uſe at all; the ſame being a Law uſeful but in peace onely.</p>
                  <p>But there are peculiar Laws, and a proper diſcipline for the ſtate of War; <hi>Sunt &amp; belli ſicut &amp; pacis jura;</hi> and they are accommodated to the very nature and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of it: ſome of which are, <hi>That there be ſolemn denouncing of the war intended, that all diſſenters may withdraw in time, and to divert other Nations from adhering; That it be proſecuted by juſt and honourable ways, without treachery, corruption, breach of faith, poyſon, or ſecret aſſaſsination,</hi> which the gallant Romans did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to act, though for never ſo great a victory: <hi>That all articles and capitulations made be ſtrictly kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, even towards Turkes, Pagans, Jews, or Infidels; That they be interpreted in the plaineſt and moſt equitable ſenſe, without any art or ſubtilty at all; That an enemy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has yielded himſelf, be not kill'd, but kept alive for exchange, or ranſome; That what is gotten from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, is good and lawful purchaſe, though it was newly taken

                  <p>For it has been the Civilians work, to draw together as it were into one body and Syſteme, all that the Civil Law it ſelf does afford, and whatſoever elſe can be gathered from
<pb facs="tcp:100164:7"/>the teſtimonies of the ancient Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Poets, and Orators, in what they are all, as it were by the light of nature, conſenting in one and the ſame judgment; alſo what has been delivered by the ancient Fathers and moſt approved Canons of the Church on that ſubject; and eſpecially to bring into argument, what has been conſtantly upon the ſame occurrences in war, judg'd and practiſed by the moſt War like and Heroick Nations, that have been; as the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Aſſyrians, Medes, Perſians, Lacedaemonians, Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but eſpecially the Romans, with whom for experience &amp; diſcipline in War, and juſtice and bravery towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; no Nation that ever acted on this great Theatre of the World, is to be compared: And ſo by theſe helps, the Laws of War in uſe at this day, have been made and perfected, only through the Civilians pains and induſtry; neither are they to be met with any where together, but in their books and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſince this profeſſion is ſo uſeful and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſouldiers buſineſs alſo, that they cannot promiſe to themſelves any good order, wiſe conduct, or happy ſucceſs with their Martial enterprizes, but by that light and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it affords, it is evident, that it could never be worſe ſpared or diſcountenanced, then now at this time. Which I humbly leave to be further thought of by the wiſdome of thoſe that rule over us.</p>

                     <p>In like manner, as nothing is more precious among men than Life, Property, good Name, Liberty, and the right of Contracts; in the which the whole civil intereſt and welfare of all people may be rightly ſaid to be compriſed. So it is not enough to provide in a general way for them neither; for it does not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to declare by a Law, that neither the Life, Property, nor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of any Subject ſhall be taken away, but by courſe of Law, and a lawful trial firſt had; nor to forbid calumnies and ſlanders, nor to command that the contracts and agreements of men ſhall be mutually obſerved: but a ſpecial and moſt vigilant care is to be had alſo, that all proceedings of juſtice, when a ſuit is brought concerning any of them, be anſwerable to thoſe great intereſts, and that nothing be admitted which can any way, though obliquely or afar off, infringe or overthrow any of them. Whereof the Civil Law is ſo tender, that by bringing the Action, a mans right is rather improved than made worſe: <hi>Nemo in perſequendo deteriorem cauſam ſed meliorem facit:</hi>

                     <p>When therefore any of theſe rights be in queſtion, if the Law of a State be ſo ſhort and defective, as that a miſchief may be done, and yet no remedy be found, or not a ſufficient one; or if a prejudicial act may paſs againſt me, that may endanger my whole right in the end, and I not preſent thereat, nor called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; or if I have not liberty to examine my adverſary upon his oath, to ſomething which will cleare the whole matter, and whereof I have no other teſtimony but his own conſcience; or if I may not be admitted to make out the matter as well by violent and ſtrong preſumptions, as by clear and manifeſt proofs; or if the teſtimony of one onely witneſſe be ſufficient in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoever to caſt and condemn me; or if where I cannot have my witneſs to the Bar through ſickneſs, or abſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, there be not ſome expedient allowed to have his teſtimony upon his oath ſent to the Court where my trial is to

For whether the rights of a people be prejudiced by an irregular way of bringing them to trial and iudgement, or by the iniquitie of thoſe Lawes that ſhall judge them in the end, the miſchief is all one. A State therefore that will ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, for defence of their peoples rights, muſt not onely take care that the Lawes that muſt definitively over-rule and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, be equal, juſt, and rational, but the formes of trial muſt be the ſame alſo, that the ſame ſecurity and juſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is the end of both, may be obtained.</p>
                     <p>And herein the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law has been more exact and careful than ſome other Lawes of the world have been, for there is nothing, of what nature ſoever it be, but the Civil Law has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a means to bring it to a diſcuſſion and trial, either by giving a ſpecial Action in the caſe<note n="l" place="margin">Tot.

And although it gives the higheſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Orders and Decrees of Court, yet it is ſo tender of, and has ſuch a heedful reſpect towards the Rights and Intereſts of men, that whether a man be concerned alone in a cauſe, or whether others be concerned with him, it allowes of no Act,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100164:18"/>Order, Decree, or Judgement, but againſt thoſe onely, that were firſt call'd to ſee it done.

                     <p>Secondly, Falſhood doth ſo ſeek to cloath it ſelf with the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and appearance of truth, that none of the ordinary ſort of men, and not all of the beſt rank neither, can diſcover or diſtinguiſh true and ſolid reaſon from that which is falſe and counterfeit. When therefore our own natural inſtinct &amp; inbred knowledge beares witneſſe to any thing, &amp; we have the warrant and allowance of the Law for it beſides, no falſe colours or ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of reaſon can deceive us: for what the wiſdome and experience of a Nation has agreed and declared to be juſt and convenient, and our hearts do own and allow to be ſo, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably carries it in the greateſt evidence and certainty of true and pure reaſon, that mortal men can attain to in things of humane and civil intercourſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Lawes of Reaſon, which, Man retaining his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal integrity, had been ſufficient to direct each particular perſon in all his affaires and duties, are not of themſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but do require the acceſſe of other Lawe, now that Man and his off-ſpring are grown thus corrupt and ſinful. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt part of men are ſuch as prefer their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate good before all things, even that good which is ſenſual, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is moſt Divine: and for that the labour or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, together with the pleaſure ariſing from the contrary, doth make men for the moſt part ſlower to the one, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the other; therefore unto Lawes it hath ſeemed alwayes needful to adde rewards, which more allure unto good then any hardneſſe deterreth from it; and puniſhments which may more deter from evil, than any ſweetneſſe thereto allureth, wherein as the generality and ſubſtance is natural, Vertue rewardable, and Vice puniſhable; ſo the particular determination of the reward or puniſhment, and all other circumſtances is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of the Laws.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when men are rebuked for acting contrary to the Law of Nature, and the Light of Reaſon, what one amongſt them commonly doth not ſtomack at ſuch contradiction, ſtorm
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100164:22"/>at reproof, and hate ſuch as would reform them. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding even they which brook it worſt, that men ſhould tell them of their duties, when they are told the ſame by a Law, think very well and reaſonably of it. becauſe they preſume that the Law doth ſpeak with all indifferency; that the Law hath no ſide-reſpect to their perſons; that the Law is as it were an Oracle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from wiſdome and underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that what Reaſon it ſelf preſcribeth, may in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry conſiderations be expedient to be ratified by a humane Law, and indeed that a humane Law ought in ſubſtance to hold forth nothing which Reaſon allowes not of.</p>

For certainly there is not a more deceitful thing than Reaſon; it being made uſe of frequently by falſe ſhews and colours to beautifie the fouleſt and moſt deformed things, and is grown to be the common gloſs that every evil does varniſh and deck it ſelf withall: alſo it is ſuch a faculty, that thoſe that are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it in the meaneſt meaſure, do infinitely extoll and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire what they apprehend to be reaſonable, though to a right judgement it be nothing ſo; and what they have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough to conceive through their own natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they do as much diſdain and condemn, how judicious and ſolid ſoever it be. Although therefore the plainer a Law is, and the more obvious to the underſtanding of thoſe that are to be guided by it, the better and the more commendable that Law muſt needs be; yet we would not have it thought, that we allow no Law to be good, but what every man that is bound by it, does immediately underſtand and approve of. For,</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100164:22"/>
                     <p>We cannot admit that the capacities of common men are ſufficient to judge of Lawes, which may be rational enough, though the reaſon of them be not ſeen to them: yet the main principles of reaſon are in themſelves apparent, and diſcernable by every eye, and it is not eaſie to finde men ignorant of them; and therefore a Law that is contrary to thoſe common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is to be abhorred. But beſides thoſe that are univerſally received and agreed on, there are other principles which are not in themſelves ſo evident, but are deductions and inferences from the firſt; and which learned and very underſtanding men onely are capable by much diſcourſe and reaſoning to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. And here beſides good natural faculties, and ripeneſſe of years, there muſt be added the right helps of true Art and Learning; ſince Education and Inſtruction are the means, the one by uſe, the other by precept, to make our natural faculty of Reaſon both the better and the ſooner able to judge rightly between Truth and Errour, Good and Evil. Nay, it it not all kind of Learning neither, which will give a man a fitneſs to diſcern, whether the Law of a Nation be conformable to right Reaſon or not; but it muſt be either all Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge joyned together, or that proper legal knowledge, which is <hi>Ars aequi &amp; boni, juſti atque injuſti Scientia,</hi> the art of Equity &amp; a good Conſcience, the knowledge of Right &amp; Wrong. Further, the Judgement is not yet come to a full degree of perfectneſs, nor competent enough, except it be fortified with a practical Knowledge too, and with a Wiſdome ariſing from Experience and Obſervation; for he that will undertake to judge whether a Law be agreeable to natural Equity and good Reaſon, he muſt not take his eſtimate from the matter of the Law one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he muſt conſider divers other circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt. He muſt ſee into the Nature, Manners, and Inclinations of the People: for the end of all Law being but to preſerve the Publick Peace, and to keep the people in good order<note n="d" place="margin">Salus populi ſuprema lex eſt.</note>, that Law muſt needs be beſt and moſt rational, which does ſooneſt produce that end. And therefore conſidering that men, even by the very climate they live under, are made to differ ſo mainly in every thing, Body, Soul, Religion, and Manners, from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100164:23"/>ſtrange variety of Lawes which we ſee and read of throughout the world, we cannot preſently conclude any of them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</p>

But foraſmuch as none did ſo uſually offend this way as men in that caſe, which they wittingly fell into, even becauſe they would be ſo much the more freely outragious; it was for their publick good where ſuch diſorder was grown, to frame a poſitive Law or Remedy thereof accordingly.

                        </note> It ought not to be looked upon as tyranny, if at any time the hand of the Law be ſometimes heavier, and ſometimes lighter, as publick neceſſities ſhall command; for without ſuch inequality of meaſure, Common wealths cannot be governed. And yet all this while here is no repugnancy to Nature neither; for the general principle of nature and of Nations, which is to puniſh offences that are paſt, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them for the future, is ſtill obſerved; onely it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to ſeveral nations which are various and differing, it cannot poſſibly be executed by the ſame coertion or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor in one and the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the form and kind of Goverment muſt be reſpected alſo; for ſome Laws may be judged very good and fitting for a Monarchy, which cannot be ſo accounted of in a Government by a few, or by the whole people, or in ſuch a one as is mixed, and made up out of them all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when a Juſtice of the Law is doubted, it muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, what urgency of affairs there was at that time when the Law was made, and whether ſome neceſſity and great reaſon of State did not enforce it. For thoſe that guide the ſtern do ſee thoſe lets and difficulties in preſerving the whole, which others cannot diſcern; and therefore it is no marvel if ſuch Lawes be enacted ſometimes, for which no reaſon can be rendred. <hi>Non omnium quae à majoribus conſtituta ſunt, ratio reddi potest;</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, A Law that may be miſchievous to divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, though otherwiſe very innocent, muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be preſently condemned as unreaſonable, ſo that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and profitable for the publick welfare. <hi>Jura non in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulas perſonas, ſed generaliter conſtituuntur,</hi>

                     <p>Fifthly, A Nationall Law that is generally and in moſt of its dictates and principles very juſt and equitable, and univerſally ſo acknowledg'd by the wiſeſt and moſt judicious men and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not to be cenſured for ſome few particular conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may ſeem hard and rigorous, or whereof the Juſtice, Equity, or Reaſon, is not ſo evident; for this enterpriſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lawes is the weightieſt thing which any man can take upon him. And where a multitude of Laws comes to be made by men (the beſt of whom are ſubject unto errors) and for caſes of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number &amp; wonderful variety, ſome few deviations, if any be, may be excuſed. It may well ſuffice that the Body is fair, and the Specks but few.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, we can by no meanes allow of their way of judging, who are ready to meaſure the goodneſſe of Lawes by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and evill practiſes of thoſe that are inſtrumental to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter them. Neither are Lawes to be judged ſuch as their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. Can a fountaine be judged the worſe, becauſe it is ſo unhappy as to run through a foule and ſlimy channell? or a chaſt Matron traduced, becauſe violence has polluted her? ſo neither can the Law be juſtly charged with the exorbitancies of men, which it ſelf condemns, and was purpoſely made to revenge and puniſh them; and would do ſo too, if violence, power, and fraud did not obſtruct its courſe.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, we can as little eſteem thoſe competent and fitting Judges of a Law, that are ſo forward to aſperſe and make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100164:24"/>becauſe by ancient inſtitution it was once miniſterial, and attended upon a power and function which they ever diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and have lately ſeen aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Upon this ground and no other that can be imagined, have divers uttered their bitter and contumelious invectives againſt the <hi>Roman Civil Law,</hi> having been helpfull in the exerciſe of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction of this Nation: which becauſe they ſee eradicated and quite taken away, they judge the other quite uſeleſſe, and therefore in their conceit ought not to be kept or continued here any longer.</p>
                     <p>In which argument were there any ſtrength of Reaſon, it might be more ſtrongly enforc'd againſt the <hi>Commmon Law</hi> it ſelfe; the intent and ſcope whereof, being to ſet up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an abſolute ſucceſſive Monarchy in this Nation, and to keep the people in a ſubjection under it; that Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now thrown down, it may be inferr'd, that the Law alſo which did found and ſupport it, ſhould never be made uſe of more, and that a Law of greater liberty and freedome ſhould be ſet up in place of it: and ſo in concluſion, the reaſon of theſe diſputants would allow us no Law at all.</p>
                     <p>But theſe muſt not be ignorant, that the <hi>Civil Law</hi> was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally made leaſt of all for Eccleſiaſticall matters, nor yet for ſo few caſes, as in this Nation it was permitted to deal in: but it was firſt ordained, to guide the mightieſt and vaſteſt Empire that the world hath yet known; and under it the ſame grew and proſpered, to the terror of its enemies, the joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of its friends and confederates, and to the aſtoniſhment of the whole Earth. Indeed before the firſt foundations of this Law were laid, the <hi>Romans</hi> did not diſdaine to fetch their Lawes from <hi>Athens,</hi> that City which was once the nurſe of Reaſon, and flouriſht in eloquence and brave atchievements more then all <hi>Greece,</hi> whence the learned Fathers of the Church ſuckt literature; <hi>Baſil</hi> his eloquence, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> his ſtrength, and others their flowing Oratory; that <hi>Athens,</hi> which who had not ſeen, is by <hi>Lyſippus</hi> accounted a very block. But ſince this beautifull fabrick of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> was reared up, and came to the perfection we now ſee it in, it did not onely order and compoſe all matters of publick Juſtice, and of private Right
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100164:25"/>in that State, but is ſince, through the ſingular treaſures of Wiſdome and pureſt Reaſon laid up there, propagated alſo to other Nations, who conſtantly uſe it in their Courts, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with their own Lawes. And in conformity to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did it come to paſſe, that the uſe of it was admitted, and brought into the Eccleſiaſticall, and other Courts of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where naturall Equity and the beſt Reaſon came to be diſpenſed, in the doing of right and juſtice; and eſpecially for commerce with Nations abroad, whereunto that knowledge is moſt requiſite.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to ſay that the <hi>Civil Law</hi> is uſeleſſe, becauſe the Eccleſiaſticall power is thrown out, is as much as if we ſaid, we have no further need of naturall Equity, or right Reaſon, nor need to treat with forreign Nations any longer, nor now be ſo wiſe as we have been, and as other Nations are.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, though the wiſeſt of a people have upon mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation agreed upon a Law, and the Legiſlative power of the Nation has enacted it, yet that does not preſently conclude the ſame to be rationall: for ſince the people of other Nations are partakers of the ſame Nature, Reaſon, Learning, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with them, except it can appear rationall to others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that are taught and guided by the ſame principles, it is not to be deemed rationall.</p>
                     <p>And from this ſingle ground onely was it, that the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> came to be ſo univerſally embraced by other Nations, and to paſſe ſo generally for a moſt rationall and juſt Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more naturall and common principles of Reaſon, Juſtice and Equity were found therein, then in any other Law of Mans ordaining; and becauſe we meet with that reaſon there, that is univerſall and common to all mankind.</p>
                     <p>And if there be any certainty of Reaſon in matters of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſcourſe, (as we muſt admit there is, elſe we ſhall put out one of the chiefeſt lights that God has given to the world) it is to be diſcovered no where ſooner, then from that, which not onely one whole Nation has agrred upon and eſtabliſhed for a Law amongſt themſelves, but which other Nations beſides them, have allowed for true reaſon, and practiſed the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo within their ſeverall territories for many hundreds of years
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100164:25"/>together; for the moſt certain token of evident reaſon is, if the generall perſwaſion of all men doe ſo account it, and when the judgements of all men generally, or for the moſt part, run one and the ſame way. <hi>Non poteſt error contingere, ubi omnes idem opinantur; &amp; quic quid in omnibus individuis unius speciei com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniter ineſt, id cauſam communem habeat oportet, quae eſt eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum individuorum species &amp; natura.</hi> No error is to be feared in ſuch matters where all men are of the ſame opinion; and what is ingrafted in every individuall of the ſame ſpecies, muſt neceſſarily proceed from one common cauſe, which is nothing but their very nature. The generall and perpetuall voice of Men, is as the ſentence of God himſelf; for that which all men have at all times learned, Nature her ſelfe muſt needs have taught; and God being the Author of Nature, her voice is but his inſtrument: By her from him we receive, whatſoever in ſuch ſort we learne.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we ſay, that the Law of a Nation ought to be conformable to Reaſon, we mean and intend ſuch Reaſon, as other Nations and Men doe generally by the inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the meanes of good Literature, and their inſight in Civil affaires, underſtand and agree to be reaſon in ſuch matters. <hi>Non enim licet naturale univerſaleque hominum judicium falſum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numque exiſtimare:</hi> It is not fitting to queſtion that which is generally allowed by all men. And that Law that approches and comes neareſt to ſuch common and univerſall reaſon, is the trueſt and perfecteſt Law of all other, and makes the people moſt happy and quiet that live under it.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, ſince this is a bleſſing that every Nation does not enjoy, froward &amp; perverſe men muſt not take an occaſion from hence, to deſpiſe and quarrel with their own Laws, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they are irrationall. <hi>Cognitio de bono &amp; malo non pertinet ad ſingulos: omne judicium in civitate eſt illius qui gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium belli &amp; gladium juſtitiae gerit. Regulae boni &amp; mali, juſti &amp; injuſti, honeſti &amp; inhoneſti, ſunt leges civiles; ideoque quod Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator praeceperit, id pro bono, quod vetuerit, id pro malo haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt.</hi> To judge what is good, and what is evill in a common ſociety, belongs not to any, that are under rule; but to him or them ſolely, in whom the Supreme Power reſteth: The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

                     <p>IF then we would know, when reaſon ought to manifeſt it ſelfe in a Law, and when it is not ſo ſtrictly required, but that ſome deviation may be permitted, we muſt obſerve a wide difference between the publick affaires of State, and thoſe of the Subjects own in their private dealings and controverſies with one another; for although all the affaires of a Nation both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, muſt be under the proviſion and rule of the Law, yet is it not neceſſary, that they ſhould both be regulated in one and the ſame manner, nor by one and the ſame reaſon; for there is a Reaſon of State, as well as a Reaſon of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

This may partly be judged by the government of a Family, be it great or little, which is many times turn'd upſide down, and diſſolved by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100164:27"/>the perverſe humour of ſome one or two, not corrigible by any wholſome Counſel, or moderate Chaſtiſement of the head of it. What marvell is it then, if in whole Kingdomes and Common-wealths, amongſt ſo many thouſands of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of different humours, there are many ſo exorbitant and turbulent, that no Wit nor power of Man can be able fairely to tame or temper them?</p>
                     <p>The Lawes therefore muſt be fitted to all ſuch publick acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, providing ſharp remedies for Diſeaſes that are acute and deſperate: neither muſt they tender the private right or ſafety of a few, if their detriment or miſchiefe may ſecure the whole.

The like muſt the eſtabliſhments of Law be, that are directed to a publick end, they muſt aime to procure the common welfare, without any reſpect to private right, or imaginary reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But in ſuch Lawes as are purpoſely made to defend every mans privaee intereſt, and to pacifie contentions and quarrels ariſing thereupon, and where the publick is not concerned, it not onely may but ought to be otherwiſe.

                     <p>Secondly, as in judged caſes, taken meerly as ſuch, there is want of reaſon to perſwade, ſo there is want of authority alſo to oblige; for what force or power can the judgements or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of any predeceſſors have to bind or limit thoſe that ſhall ſucceed them in the ſame Judicatory? <hi>Par in parem non habet imperium, nec aliquis in ſeipſum;</hi> Judges of equall power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe any rule over one another, nor indeed can any one tye up ones own ſelf.<note n="b" place="margin">L. <hi>13.</hi> parag. <hi>4.</hi> Dig ad S.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100164:29"/>of Men may wax perfecter by age, ſtudy, and experience, than they were when they gave their firſt judgement: And thoſe that do ſucceed, may be by many degrees more eminent in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Reaſon, Knowledge, and Eperience, than thoſe that ſate in the ſame Tribunals before them; for there is in this world an undoubted wheeling in all things; Knowledge, Wit, and Underſtanding does not ſhine and proſper ſo in ſome times, as in other ſucceeding times they do; and time to poſterity may diſcover that to be an errour, which our Anceſtors thought a truth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there muſt needs be little value and weight laid upon foregoing Judgements, even of the higheſt and moſt exemplary tribunals of men; nor can they be eſteemed ſuch fit patterns for our imitation, when it is conſidered what uncertainties they lye under, what failings they are ſubject to, and what arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſubtilties, inventions, practiſes, and other undue means are too too frequently uſed to corrupt and poyſon them. For,</p>
                     <p>Sometimes <hi>pars major vincit meliorem,</hi> the greater part weighs down the better. Where many Judges are to pronounce Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome one or two of them be eminently qualified above all the reſt, that which the greater number concurs in onely, muſt prevail and take effect; but if the wiſeſt be diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>numero potius quam ſcientia judicatur,</hi> there is more of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than of weight or knowledge in ſuch a ſentence.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he, in whoſe favour ſentence is given, carries it but by one vote more than he againſt whom it paſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes ſome one of the Judges being more renowned, or happily more eloquent than his fellowes, does either through his greatneſſe, ſpeech, dexterity, or wit, draw all the reſt into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by his too powerful interpoſing.</p>
                     <p>But the danger of paſſing wrong and erroneous judgement is greater, where the office and power of judging reſts in one ſingle perſon only, ſince it is eaſier to draw away and overcome one than many.

                     <p>Moſt States employ their conſideration moſt upon the publick welfare, and upon ſuch intereſts as have an univerſall effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole body, as eaſieſt to be ſeen, and requiring but one and the ſame remedy for all. But in a numerous multitude, and where their tranſactions and dealings with one another are ſo various, and indeed by different circumſtances become infinite; to ſuit each perſons caſe and buſineſſe with a proper and fitting rule to decide it, is a work ſo void of end or bottome, and paſt finiſhing, that no ſtate will ſet upon the enterprize to begin it; eſpecially when the Art and Science of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> has done it to their hands ſo excellently well, and with ſo much wiſdome, pure reaſon, and true naturall equity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> (who through the largeneſſe of their Empire, and the long continuance of it, had dealings with the greateſt part of the World then inhabited and found out, and ſo had beyond other Nations, the greateſt opportunity to ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull variety of queſtions and controverſies, that fall out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man in their mutuall tranſactions, when ſuch a numberleſſe number of them came before their own Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) they chiefly minded the regulation of ſuch matters; the Lawes that are now extant, being almoſt wholly taken up in them, and handling the publick very ſparingly; for of the fifty books of the Digeſts, nine and forty do almoſt wholly conſiſt of theſe private controverſiall things. They have taken up likewiſe all the Code, ſaving a little of the firſt book of it, &amp; the three laſt Books of all. The Inſtitutes are altogether ſpent herein, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one Title <hi>De publicis Judiciis,</hi> which is the laſt of all.</p>
                     <p>Hereof <hi>Cujacius</hi> and <hi>Duarenus</hi> render this reaſon: <hi>Ideo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum eſt jus publicum,</hi> ſay they, <hi>quod parum videretur ejus cognitie ſingulis eſſe neceſſaria, quòd de rebus privatis frequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores eſſent lites, quodque rarò de jure publico interrogaretur:</hi> Therefore by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws ſo little was declared concerning the publick, becauſe the knowledge of ſuch matters was ſo little
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100164:36"/>neceſſary for private men, and for that moſt ſuits were brought for differences betwixt one ſubject and another, as alſo becauſe little advice was asked upon that which concerned the generall welfare.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing therefore upon which a Controverſie may be raiſed in our dealings with one another in this life, but to caſt the right where it ought to go, there may be found out in the ſtudy of the Civil Law, that, which though it was a Law to the Romans only, yet has it the force of profound, pure, ſolid reaſon to all other men; ſo perfect, abſolute, and ſo rational a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme is it of all humane affaires and dealings whatſoever. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we able to prize or eſteeme the ſingular benefit that hath grown unto the world by the Roman Civil Law, being ſtill extant, as the value thereof deſerveth.</p>
                     <p>For the precepts of Nature, and the rules of Natural Reaſon, whereof it aboundeth, are either ſuch as we of our ſelves could not eaſily have found out, and then the benefit is not ſmall to have them readily ſet down to our hands; or if they be ſo clear and manifeſt, that no man indued with reaſon can eaſily be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them, yet the Law as it were borrowing them from the ſchool of Nature, to prove other things leſſe manifeſt, and to induce a neceſſary conſequence of ſomething which were in it ſelf more hard and dark, unleſſe it ſhould in ſuch ſort be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the very applying of them unto caſes particular, is not without moſt ſingular uſe and profit many wayes for mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, be they plain of themſelves or obſcure, the evidence of ſo renowned a Law added unto the natural aſſent of reaſon concerning the certainty of them, doth not a little authorize and confirm the ſame. Wherefore in as much as our actions are converſant about things beſet with many circumſtances, which cauſe men of ſundry wits to be alſo of ſundry judgments concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which ought to be done, beneficial it cannot but ſeem, that the rule of Civil Law has herein helped our infirmity, whereby we do ſo well underſtand what is right and juſt, and what otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Though the firſt principles of the Law of Nature are eaſie and diſcerned generally by all men, yet concerning the duty which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100164:37"/>Natures law doth require at the hands of men in a number of things particular, ſo far hath the natural underſtanding even of ſundry whole Nations been darkned, that they have not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no not groſſe injuſtice and injury to be ſo. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth how much we are bound to admire the profound wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and even honour the memory of the Roman Lawgivers, who have delivered ſuch a Law to the world; a Law wherein ſo many things are laid open, cleare, and manifeſt as a light which otherwiſe might have been buried in darkneſſe, not without the hazard, or rather not with the hazard, but with the certain loſſe of the rights of many men and nations.</p>
                     <p>For albeit there is in the Civil Law, as there is and muſt be in all Lawes whatſoever, a very great intermixture of ſuch things as are eſtabliſhed by the voluntary determination, and proceed from the meere will and pleaſure of thoſe that have ordained them, who might limit Times, Places, Forms, Actions, Rewards, puniſhments; &amp; difference Perſons, &amp; might order and diſpoſe of all Circumſtances in what way and manner they pleaſed, as the Nature, Manners, Government, and Occaſions of the Roman people moſt required, without any reſpect to common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Reaſon, and are therefore neither obligatory nor uſefull to any other State or Nation, as they were to the Roman: yet there is in it a rational and natural part alſo, which belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men as men, or to men as they live in politick ſociety, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of ſuch common and natural notions, and ſo abſtracted from ſuch circumſtances which ſhould change and alter it, that it is alwayes permanent, alike known to all men, or at leaſt to the wiſer ſort of men, obligatory, and uſeful every where. And never was there any Humane Law that abounded ſo much with this, as the Civil Law doth, it being to be found every where about the whole Law, though intermixed with that which is meerely poſitive, proper and uſefull for that State and none elſe, or at leaſt not fitting to be made a Rule for all people.</p>
                     <p>By Natural and Rational I underſtand that which our own natural underſtanding allowes as good, or diſallowes as evil, though there were no Law to forbid the one, or to preſcribe the other. And this was the ſame, which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> expreſſes to be

                        </note> I dare not queſtion that which is generally allowed of.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe I account that natural and rational which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and behoofefull for thoſe that lead their lives in any well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered ſtate of government, and without which we take away all poſſibility of a ſociable life in the world.</p>
                     <p>Further, that juſtice may well be eſteemed natural and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is ſquared by and accommodated to the nature of the thing in queſtion, as it is defined, and as it generally paſſes in the account of all, or at leaſt the moſt knowing men.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I account that only to be natural &amp; rational which was ſo when the firſt foundations of the world were laid, &amp; man became in habitant thereof; for then all things were common, and men were not gathered into civil ſocieties; neither was there any diſtinction of Nations, nor any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts, no waging War, nor leading Captive, nor ſervitudes, nor conjunction of Dwellings, nor any limits ſet to the property of each Man &amp; Nation, as we ſee at this day. Therefore that muſt be looked upon as natural and rational, which ſuits with the preſent ſtate of affairs, as they now ſtand in the world at this time: for though the Natural Law be alwaes the ſame, yet ſome parts of it are primely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, others by ſuppoſition and accident, and both are of the ſame neceſſity, that is, equally neceſſary in the ſeveral caſes. Thus, to obey a King is as neceſſary and naturally reaſonable as to obey a Father, though the firſt Governour of all; that is, ſuppoſing there be a King, as it is certain naturally a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but a father muſt be ſuppoſed. If it be made neceſſary that I promiſe, it is alſo neceſſary that I perform it; for elſe I ſhall return to that inconvenience which I ſought to avoid, when I made the promiſe: And though the inſtance be very far removed from the firſt neceſſities and accidents of our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100164:38"/>prime being and production; yet the reaſon ſtill purſues us, and natural reaſon reaches out to the very laſt minutes, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the moſt remote particulars of our well being. Moreover, beſides the natural and rational part before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which either ſimply concerneth men as men, or which belongeth unto them as they are men linked with others in ſome form of politick ſociety; there is another ſort thereof, which ſerves to order and direct all ſuch ſeveral bodies politick, ſo far forth as one of them hath publick co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce with another: for although civil ſociety doth more content the nature of man than any private kind of ſolitary living, becauſe in ſociety this good of mutual participation is ſo much larger than otherwiſe: yet we are not ſatisfied herewith, but we covet (if it might be) to have a kinde of ſociety and fellowſhip with all mankind.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100164:38"/>other be put to implore the aid of other Nations, either in the way of trade, to put off their own commodities in exchange for others, or elſe to ſecure themſelves againſt a collected force that is about to invade them. Hence we often ſee, even mighty Princes and people ſo ſtrongly ſollicit to be in league with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States.</p>
                     <p>This naturall inclination that is in the men of the World, to have the knowledge of, and acquaintance and friendſhip each with other, how farre diſtant ſoever they be, did appear ſo much in <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he profeſſed himſelfe a Citizen, not of this or that Common-wealth, but of the World. And an effect of that very naturall deſire in us (a manifeſt token that we wiſh after a ſort an univerſall fellowſhip with all men) ſhewes it ſelfe by the wonderfull delight men have, ſome to viſit forreigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, ſome to diſcover Nations not heard of in former ages; we all, to know the affaires and dealings of other people, yea to be in league of amity with them, and this not onely for traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique ſake, or to the end that when many are Confoederated, each may make the other more ſtrong; but for ſuch cauſe alſo as moved the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> to viſit <hi>Solomon;</hi> and in a word, becauſe Nature doth preſume, that how many men there are in the World, ſo many Gods as it were there are, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch they ſhould be towards Men. Further, this converſing with forreigne States gets us an opportunity to diſcerne their inclinations, know their ſtrength and riches, or find their weakneſſe, and ſometimes to diſcover their ſecret machinations againſt our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus whilſt we travaile and ſend out into other Nations, in purſuit of our ſeverall ends and intereſts, we fall at length to contract, exchange, tranſport, and ſo by degrees eſtabliſh a fixed trade for return of commodities each to other. This draws on firme leagues of amity and friendſhip, capitulations to fight againſt our common enemies, and mutually to defend our ſelves. And this cannot be tranſacted without the help of Embaſſies, and the mediation of Miniſters, by whom the mindes of both are made known, and our agreements ſealed and confirmed. Sometimes injury is done by our neighbour Nations, or their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, either in ſtaying our Ships, ſeizing our goods, reſtraining
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100164:39"/>our perſons, or protecting the publick and declared enemies of the Nation, which cauſeth us to demand redreſſe and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which if it be denyed or delayed us, if the offence comes from particular men, we right our ſelves upon ſome ſubjects onely by way of reprizall; if from the State it ſelfe, or the moſt conſiderable part thereof, then followes the denouncing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Warre, and all the concomitants thereof.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100164:42"/>Contract, Speech or Writing whatſoever; of Cuſtomes and other publick duties payable to the Exchequer, Authorities, Powers or Commiſſions granted to others: Deeds of free gift, Writings obligatory, Inſtruments, Pattents, Charters, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in Writing or by preſcription; Cuſtomes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to take away or diminiſh the right and property of others: of reparations upon fraud, non-age, abſence, or other impediments unavoidable and neceſſary; Nuſances done in publick places or High-wayes, or from one Houſe to another, obſtructions in Rivers or Water-courſes, Mortgages in Law as well as Fact: of goods loſt in Ships, Taverns, Inns, or delivered to Carriers to convey to other places, or left with other Men to keep; ſervices due to the Common-wealth, patrimoniall, perſonall, and mixt, Souldiers, and the exemptions and diſcipline belonging to them: Of judiciall Tryalls in all theſe cafes and many more, where the quality of the Judge, his kind of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the manner of Tryall, the Officers aſſiſting, the kind of Evidence, the Judgement, the Execution thereof, or remedy by way of Appeale come to be conſidered: I ſay, when the conſideration of theſe ſeverall matters is as incident to all other Nations and times that live under Order and Government, as it was to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and that there be delivered and laid down in the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> ſuch rules and dictates as are moſt naturall, eſſentiall, and neceſſary to be obſerved in each of them; it muſt needs be, that the uſe of the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> in theſe particulars, as to the matter of it, can neither be locall nor temporary, neither be limited to that Empire, nor determine with it, but muſt be of uſe every where and for ſo long time as the buſineſſe to which thoſe rules are applyed, comes to be acted and dealt in, which will be as long as the World it ſelfe endures, and untill men leave to traffique and converſe with one another.</p>
                     <p>Now as in the matters before ſpecified, the difference that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes may be ſometimes between the publike and ſome private perſon, ſometimes between one private man and another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame Nation; ſo it may be alſo between a ſubject and a ſtranger, or between ſtrangers only, or between Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet the ſame meaſure of juſtice will hold and ſerve for all. For look what juſtice may be rightly afforded between one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100164:42"/>man and another upon the generall rule of naturall equity and right reaſon, the ſame may as warrantably be diſpenſed between one Nation and another, as oft as any variance happens between them.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is that all thoſe Writers that handle and treat of thoſe controverſiall things, which frequently come to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed between one Nation and another, as they are all Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo though they doe make uſe of other authorities beſides, yet the ſtrongeſt and moſt convincing arguments that they bring to reſolve them by, are fetcht from the generall rules of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and right Reaſon ſet down in the Civil Law. And were it not for them, we had no certainty to reſt upon, nor any peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able determination could be made of ſuch controverſies, but the ſharpeſt Sword muſt be drawn out to cut the knot aſunder: For what can Hiſtories and the examples drawn from them doe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a compoſure? <hi>Errant, qui quod exemplo fit id etiam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fieri putant,</hi> ſayes<note n="r" place="margin">De ju &amp; offic.

                     <p>And moreover, by as it were a generall conſent of Nations, there is an appealing to, and a reſting in the voice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Civil Law, in theſe caſes between Nation and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe any thing that is irrationall, unnatural, abſurd, partial, injuſt, immodeſt, ignoble, treacherous or unfaithfull, that Law abhorreth; and for that it is the moſt perfect image and repreſentation of Nature, and of the Equity and Reaſon Nature preſcribes to humane actions, that was ever yet preſented or ſet forth to the World in a Law.

                     <p>There was never any Law more agreeable to the Divine, and to the rules of Conſcience and exact righteouſneſſe, then that Law. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologetick againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, <hi>Eorum leges ad innocentiam pergere, &amp; de divina lege ut antiquiore, ferme mutuatas;</hi> that their Laws did walk in the way to innocence, and were almoſt the ſame with the Divine Law. <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> another Divine and a Proteſtant, ſayes that and more: <hi>Ad normam effictam in mentibus humanis, &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogi voce declaratam atque illuſtratam congruunt humanae leges, quae citra controverſiam poſt Moſaicas caeteris ut antiquitate, ſic dignitate; ut auctoritate ſic veritatis certitudine; ut rationum &amp; damonſtrationum evidentia, ſic ordinis praeſtantia antecellunt:</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes, ſaith he, are made after the likeneſſe of the Decalogue, and do not differ from thoſe notions and principles of Reaſon which Nature hath implanted in all men. And it is out of all queſtion, that ſetting aſide Gods Law, they are as more ancient, ſo more renowned; as of higher authority, ſo truer and clearer in determination; as of a more evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and reaſon, ſo of a more excellent rank then other Laws that yet have been.</p>

                     <p>Which conformity and likeneſſe of the Civil Law to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Eternall, has been the onely cauſe, that the Caſuſts and Divines that have created upon caſes of Conſcience, and have laboured to teach men what rules they muſt walk by, to doe juſtice, and to execute righteouſneſſ in their dealings and communications with one another, they doe every where about their books and writings, propoſe &amp; ſet down the very rules and maxims of the Civil Law as the beſt leſſons of morality &amp; juſtice, citing the very Lawes themſelves, and the authorities of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; which were incongruous and vain for them to doe, were not their juſtice, equity, and ſoundneſſe unqueſtionable, and their authority beyond all diſpute, even in thoſe things for which their authority is brought by them. Neither is it they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that ſet this high eſtimate upon the authority of the Civil Law, ſince the Learned in other faculties doe the ſame: with whom there is nothing more frequent, then when the duties of men one towards another in their ſeverall relations com to be ſet forth, as between Parents and Children, Maſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Husband and Wife, Sovereign and Subject, Magiſtrates and private Men, Captain and Souldiers, one Citizen with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or when the beſt rules and advantages are to be laid down for the firſt founding of a Common-wealth, or the keeping of it in ſafety and ſplendour; or when the juſtice and convenience of a Law is in queſtion; or the actions of Men, even of Princes themſelves, be to be approved or condemned: In all theſe caſes and the like, nothing I ſay is more uſuall with Writers of higheſt renown for Learning and wiſdome, then to fort fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Neither does it derogate from the clemency of the Civil Law, that it ſeems to deal ſo ſharply with thoſe (againſt whom there are grounds enough to ſuſpect them of ſome enormous crimes whereof they are accuſed, but not evidence full enough to condemn them) as to allow ſuch perſons to be<note n="c" place="margin">Dig. &amp; Co. de Quaeſtion.</note> ſet upon the Rack, thereby to manifeſt their innocence by an obſtinate denial, or to diſcover their guilt by a plain confeſſion.

                     <p>When a man is criminally accuſed, there are but two wayes to convict him, either by his confeſſion, or by proof. As to confeſſion; where is it ſeen that he that dares to offend high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he comes to be examined, does not deny it as boldly?
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100164:46"/>and who is there that does not excuſe him for ſeeking thus to preſerve himſelf? <hi>Ignoſcendum eſt ei qui ſanguinem ſuum qualiter qualiter redemptum voluit,</hi> ſayes the<note n="d" place="margin">l. <hi>1.</hi> Dig. <hi>De</hi> bonis eorum qui ante.</note> Civil Law it ſelf; that is, He is to be pardoned, meaning as to puniſhment, that labours by any means to avoid the ſhedding of his own bloud.

                        </note> Books of Law, we ſhall find that there has been a kind of trial very anciently in uſe amongſt our ſelves here in <hi>England,</hi> very near to this of the Romans, and in ſeverity no whit inferiour: For there were certain Ordeal Laws which were uſed in ſuch doubtful caſes, whereby when clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt proofs were wanting, they did try and find out whether the accuſed were guilty or guiltleſs. And this they were wont to execute one of theſe three wayes, either by fire, or by water, or by combate. For ſometimes men were enforced to decide matters in controverſie not onely criminal but civil, by the death of one another in a Duel. Sometimes they were adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take red-hot Irons into their bare hands; and ſometimes to<note n="u" place="margin">Which was practiſed upon <hi>Queen Emma</hi> the Mother of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, to clear her ſelf of Adultery with <hi>Allwin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> or as ſome write, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Allwin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Harkwill.

Their judgment by water was either by appointing the party accuſed to thruſt his armes up to his elbows in ſeething hot water, or by having a cord tied about him under his armes, to be caſt into ſome river.</p>
                     <p>In theſe caſes, if the accuſed parties go over ſeven plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares laid a little diſtance one from another, and either tread
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100164:48"/>beſides them, or treading upon them with their bare feet, or taking the hot irons in their bare hands, did receive no harm: and ſo if the parties putting their armes into the hot water, were not ſcalded; or they that were caſt into a river, did ſink down into the bottom thereof until they were drawn up; they were pronounced innocent and not guilty: but if they were burnt by the hot irons, or ſcalded by the hot water, or could not ſink to the bottome of the river, or were ſlain or vanquiſhed in the combate, in ſuch caſes they were pronounced guilty.</p>
                     <p>But further, this great but moſt wholſome ſeverity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, was tempered with a very great allay of tenderneſs and care towards the accuſed offender; as may be ſeen by the many and moſt prudent cautions that were obſerved in it. For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the offence in which ſuch trial was allowed, was to be enormous, and not ſo little<note n="x" place="margin">Gomez, ver Reſol. Tom. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>13.</hi> nu. <hi>2.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, it never could be had where there could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a full and a ſufficient proof to condemn without it.

                     <p>Thirdly, before a man could be brought to the rack, the offence was to be made out<note n="z" place="margin">Multis inditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is oneratus, &amp; argumentis penè convictus reu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Sixthly, The Law notwithſtanding gave ſo little credit to any confeſſion made under ſuch bitter ſufferings, becauſe it might be extored by force, and out of a hope to be rid of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pain, rather then that they were the words of truth, that it would never condemn upon any ſuch confeſſion, except the party accuſed being redeemed from his pain, and in his full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, did again confeſs the very ſame thing; nor then neither, if that which was confeſſed were more probable to be falſe then true.</p>

                     <p>As it treats the living with all gentleneſs and equity, ſo it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its humanity and tender conſideration to the dead too, and is indulgent to thoſe that lie in their very graves.

                     <p>And if there be ſuch a cuſtome which I have heard is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by ſome-pariſhes within this Nation, and practiſed alſo, that when a dead corps is carried through towards ſome further place of burial, it may be ſtaied upon the way, and not ſuffered to proceed till ſome fee or toll be paid; it is ſuch a cuſtome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100164:50"/>which the Civil Law is againſt. For that Law expreſly provides, <hi>ne corpora aut oſſa mortuorum detinerentur aut vexarentur; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve prohiberentur, quo minus via publica transferrentur, aut quò minus ſepelirentur;</hi> that the bodies and bones of the dead be not ſtaied or troubled, nor that any reſtraint be to hinder their paſſage along the high-way to and fro, or to obſtruct their burial.<note n="a" place="margin">l. <hi>38.</hi> Dig. de Mortu Infer.</note> And generally without exception either of place or perſon, ſayes directly, that no ſuch ſee or toll ſhall be paid.<note n="b" place="margin">Graec.

                     <p>And ſurely if the firſt ground from whence that cuſtome came were known, we ſhould be willing for Religion ſake to lay it down. For our ſuperſtitious anceſtours believing that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the living were uſeful to the ſouls of the dead, were wont as often as they carried forth any dead body to be buried, to ſtay in every convenient Town through which they went, to receive the prayers of the devout people for the ſoul of their deceaſed Brother; In recompence whereof it is probable, that ſomething was in charity beſtowed for the poor of that place, or to ſome other end. Which at firſt proceeding from bounty, we have no cauſe to turn it into a duty, eſpecially to paſs an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon the dead, and when we beſtow not the prayers as they did, nor indeed can think them profitable as they applied them.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the Law ſo careful to conduct the dead quietly to their graves, as it is ſevere in puniſhing thoſe that ſhall diſturb their bodies there, or ſhall demoliſh or deface their ſepulchres. The place where the dead body lies is eſteemed Religious, and the injury done to the body it ſelf, or to the monument thereof, is accounted no leſs then ſacriledge.<note n="x" place="margin">l Co.

                     </p>
                     <p>If it be done riotouſly and with Armes, the crime is capital; if without, it is to be conſidered whether the body be pull'd out of the grave, and then it is capital to thoſe of the meaner ſort, but others of better rank are baniſhed, or condemned to work in the Mines.

                     <p>In congruity therefore of reaſon muſt it be concluded, that a Nation in all other things ſo much ſuperiour unto others, muſt alſo have Laws and rules of conduct proportionable; elſe could they never have brought to paſs ſo great and glorious things as they did: For by the benefit of wholſome Laws and prudent order is it, that great atchievements are accompliſhed in a Common-wealth, and ſuch mighty works effected.

                     <p>And well it is obſerved and delivered by many later writers, that in the Romane Empire, the greatneſs thereof is rather to be imputed and aſcribed to the wiſdome of their Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then to their armes and valour.

For he brings in <hi>Cato</hi> ſpeaking to the Romans of his own time, that had much degenerated from their Anceſtors: Think not, ſaith he, that our Anceſtry brought the City into this height by armes; if it were ſo, we ſhould make it far more admirable then ever, for we have greater plenty and abundance of men, more confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, a greater ſtore alſo of armes and horſes then they had. But they had other means which we want, induſtry at home, equity abroad, freedome in conſultation, and purity of minds in all men, free from luſt and enormity: For theſe we have gotten riot and avarice, publick beggery and private wealth: riches we praiſe, and ſloth we follow: good and bad are now undiſtinguiſhed, ambition devouring all the rewards due to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Nor wonder at it, when each one patcheth up a private eſtate; when you ſerve you luſts at home, and your profit and partiality here in the Senate. This is it that laies the State open to all incurſion of others. Again, in the ſame place he ſayes of them, That they were greedy of praiſe, and bountiful of their purſes; they loved glory and wealth honeſtly gotten; Honour they dearly affected, but through virtue, offering willingly both their lives and their eſtates for renown. The zealous deſire of this one thing made them ſet aſide all other inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever; and hence they deſired to keep their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try firſt in freedome, and then in Soveraignty; becauſe they ſaw how baſeneſs went with ſervitude, and glory with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.<note n="f" place="margin">Amore primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùs libertaris, poſt ctiam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationis, &amp; cupiditate laudis &amp; glo iae multa magna <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <argument>
                        <p>The fundamentals of the Roman Civil Law were fetch'd from other States, which did then excel others moſt in Policy and Government.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe firſt grounds and foundations of the Civil Law were not of the Romans own compoſing, but were fetch'd from other Nations, and thoſe the beſt governed that were in being; for when they had caſt off Kingly government, and put themſelves into the form of a Common wealth, they would no longer endure the Laws that their Kings had made, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſuffer any memory of their power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and partly becauſe the ſetting up of a new government would require neceſſarily the making alſo of new Laws, which might correſpond therewith. Therefore ſince a preſent ſupply of Laws was neceſſary (arbitrary rule being intolerable) and that to frame a body of Laws themſelves in a ſhort time, was impoſſible, and not by a new-born State to be effected; they appointed three eminent men to go to <hi>Athens,</hi> and other Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Cities which had been famous for rule and adminiſtration of juſtice above others, to fetch from thence the choiceſt Laws they could find.</p>
                     <p>At the return of thoſe three men, the Conſuls that had bore the ſway were depoſed, and both their Authority and Enſigne
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100164:62"/>given unto ten men newly elected for the government of the State, and were thence called <hi>Decemviri,</hi> whoſe office it was to ſelect the beſt of theſe Laws, and by them preciſely to rule and do juſtice to all the people. The Laws that they choſe and beſt approved of, were written at firſt in ten Tables of Braſs, to which two Tables more being added afterwards, they were all ſet up together in the open Market-place to be ſeen and read by the people, which ever after were diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Leges</hi> 12 <hi>Tabularum,</hi> The Laws of the 12 Tables.</p>
                     <p>To the direction of theſe Laws the Roman people were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and conformed themſelves for a long time, and they were the onely Law they had: Of the which <hi>Tully</hi>

                     <p>And although their engravement in braſs could not preſerve them from the injury of time, nor reſcue them from that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal change that altered all things in the Roman Empire; whereby it came to paſs, that ſome reliques onely of them are now extant, to the lamentation of all the learned: Yet the Hiſtorians without any diſagreeing tell us, that the riſe and beginning of all the Civil Law that we have in the books of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> came from thoſe Laws; Thus <hi>Livie, Tacitus, Sigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Roſinus.</hi> And no leſs is delivered by <hi>Pomponius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his large Narrative of the beginning and progreſs of the Civil Law;<note n="p" place="margin">l. 2.

                     </p>
                     <p>And hence it is that every where throughout the Body of the Civil Law frequent and common mention is made of the Laws of the 12 Tables, and ſeveral of them entirely recited; and ſome of them confirmed and enlarged; others quite taken away; ſome of them diminiſhed onely, as to ſome circumſtances; others interpreted, as being very obſcure and doubtful; ſome declared in what caſes they ſhall be of force, and in what not: and others ſtretch'd to other caſes not provided for in expreſs words, but in preſumption thereby intended, becauſe ſo much alike to them that were expreſſed.</p>

And further, the Law proceedeth in avoiding and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulling all contracts, negotiations and dealings, which ſuch perſons ſhall have made for themſelves, after Guardians are once aſſigned them; yet with this difference, that a Prodigal, or ſuch as have common reaſon, though otherwiſe very impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and needing a curator, may contract to advantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not to their loſs and hinderance: But ſuch as want capacitie and underſtanding, can do no good for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.<note n="u" place="margin">L. <hi>6.</hi> Dig.

                     <p>And although the Law of the 12 Tables ſeems to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guardian of ſuch diſabled perſons abſolute power over their eſtates, yet the Civil Law will have that underſtood to reach no further then to the husbanding of their eſtates for their uſe and benefit; for it will not permit them to ſell, aliene, or mortgage any thing that does belong unto them, except that upon examination of the Magiſtrate it be found advantageable and fit to be done, and that the Magiſtrate does expreſly make his decree to that purpoſe. Inſomuch as if money be taken up by the Guardian for the need and to the uſe of any ſuch perſon, and his land mortgaged for payment of it, yet if it be not done by the licenſe of the Magiſtrate, the ſerving of that impotent mans neceſſity how extreme ſoever, will not make that mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the more forcible; ſuch care has the Law to preſerve the patrimony of ſuch from being paſs'd away.

                     <p>So that generally it may be obſerved, what Laws ſoever are written almoſt on any ſubject, are but as ſo many explanations or enlargements, made by the old primitive Lawyers, ſuch as <hi>Gaius, Scaevola, Papinian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, Paulus, Affrican,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Worthies, and are as it were their Comments on the Law of Nature and of Nations, and upon this Law of the 12 Tables; at firſt a forreign Law, but brought into the Roman Common-wealth by a common conſent of all the people, from ſuch Nations as for rule and government might juſtly be an example to all their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the Sea Laws that were admitted into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State, and incorporated amongſt their Laws, were fetch'd from another people, namely the people of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> Iſlanders in the Carpathian Sea, bordering upon <hi>Caria</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the mighty concourſe of ſeafaring-men thither, and their continual trade and potency by Sea, grew ſo expert in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all matters and differences thereto appertaining, and their determinations therein were eſteemed ſo juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that their Laws in ſuch affairs have been held oracles ever ſince.

Therefore what either their allies or enemies afforded that was uſeful and fitting, they greedily embraced and practiſed it in their own State.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>Saluſt</hi> may be thought partial, becauſe a Roman writer, let <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeak, that was a Graecian: They were always ſo wiſe, ſaith he, as, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And ſo in theſe Laws of ours we have what all the wiſeſt and nobleſt men in that Common-wealth (which was the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and potent that ever was in the world) could of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their wiſdome and reaſon deviſe, or could learn from other States in about a thouſand years; for about ſo many years it was from the time of the Decemvirate unto <hi>Juſtinians</hi> death. <hi>Tantae molis erat Romanas condere leges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this example of the Romans, who admitted ſo freely other Laws beſides their own, and would rather ſend about to borrow Laws from others, then want ſuch as were neceſſary and convenient for themſelves, we may learn to eſteem it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhameful nor inconvenient for the people of this Nation, to give ſuch an admittance to the Roman Civil Law here, as the Romans did in their State to the Laws of other Nations: For it muſt needs draw after it much benefit, and no prejudice, if it be done with theſe cautions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that it be a free and a voluntary act of our own, and not impoſed upon us by a forreign power.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it be admitted meerly to ſupply the defects of our own Laws, and to have a reſolving power in ſuch caſes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100164:64"/>onely, where our own Laws have made no determination at all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſo little to be made uſe of in oppoſition to our own municipal Law, as not ſo much as to be compared with it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that it be of greateſt force in all caſes where there is greateſt need of equity and a good conſcience, whereof there is more to be found in that Law then in any other Law of Man.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, that it may order and determine all matters tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ariſing upon the Sea, or contracted and done in forreign parts, to which the Laws of the Land are moſt incongruous, and leſs ſatisfactory to thoſe whom they concern, being chiefly ſtrangers and of another Nation.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that if at any time the uſe and exerciſe thereof ſhould be ſtretch'd beyond the bounds that are allowed it, it ſhould be penall; but be check'd by ſuch equal and indifferent Umpires, as are parties in neither of both profeſſions: For where an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochment is pretended to be made by either Law upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither ſeems to be competent enough to judge the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or to condemn the other.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe cautions, to admit the uſe of the Civil Law into this Nation, that in the doing of juſtice, where our own Laws fail, we may be ſure to be ſupplied by another, is no more then what the Romans themſelves, a renowned and wiſe people, did by the Laws of other Nations, and what other Nations do at this day by the Civil Law it ſelf, which they do practiſe and uſe as frequently as they do their own.</p>

                        <p>That time and intervenience of fatal Accidents, that has ſwept away ſo many States together with all their Laws, and has quite aboliſhed the Romans State it ſelf, has not yet been of force to aboliſh the Roman Civil Law, but that it is extant ſtill.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEſides that this Law was at firſt derived from ſuch Nations as in their time were renowned for Policy and Wiſdome, and was a chief means to convey the Romans to their greatneſs; this alſo may be ſaid thereof that can be ſaid of no other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law beſides, That though it has been never ſeen that any Law has laſted longer then the State it ſelf for whch it was firſt ordained, but both have been buried in the ſame ſepulchre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; yet this Law is in being to this very day, after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State it ſelf has ſo long laine intombed in its own aſhes. <hi>Jus Juſtiniani praeſcriptum libris, non Civitatis tantùm eſt, ſed &amp; Gentium &amp; naturae; &amp; aptatum ſic eſt ad naturam univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, ut imperio extincto, ipſum jus diu ſepultum ſurrexerit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; in omnes ſe effuderit gentes humanas.

                        </note> The Law that is ſet down in the books of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> is not the Law of one City onely, but is the Law of Nature and Nations; and is ſo throughout fitted to very Nature it ſelf, that when the Roman Empire was quite extinct, yet the Law of the Empire, after it had lain long as it were buried, ſprung up again, and ſpread it ſelf into all Nations. Therefore now it is become a ſtanding Law to Princes, although made at firſt by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> for the uſe of private men.</p>
                     <p>We know for certain, that at the firſt erecting of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, when ſome certain kind of regiment was once approved, nothing was then further thought upon for the manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, but all permitted unto their wiſdome and diſcretion,

                     <p>Hence it has come to paſs, that the Laws of ſome certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been more famous then the Laws of others, and the Authours mentioned with high praiſe and commendation. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who made Laws for the Athenians, and was accounted one
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100164:66"/>of the ſeven Sages in Greece, is highly commended for his great wiſdome in making Laws both by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> who propoſeth him and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Lacedaemonian Law-giver, as patterns for all ſuch as ſhall inſtitute Common-wealths, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe Laws for them. <hi>Plato</hi> alſo prayſeth the Cretenſian Laws, and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> the Laws of <hi>Lacedaemon. Zaleucus</hi> is upon record too for being a great Law-giver amongſt the Locrians: and <hi>Charondas</hi> has got himſelf a name for the Laws the Thurians had from him; And ſo has <hi>Zamolxis, Pythagoras</hi> his ſcholar, for the Laws he gave the <hi>Getae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet of all theſe Laws ſo much extolled and ſpoken of amongſt the Learned, there is not one extant to this day in any entire body; I ſay, in an entire body, becauſe of the Attick Law ſome fragments may be found, which the induſtry of <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> has collected out of ſeveral Greek Authours, as <hi>Athenaeus, Plato, Plutarch, Demoſthenes,</hi> and others, where they lay diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which though they may buſie Criticks and thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon Antiquity, yet are of no uſe to govern a State by, nor to decide differences that ariſe in common intercourſe. As it is no ſmall wonder then, ſo does it adde much to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Roman Civil Law, that it has not been ſwept away by that common fate under which theſe and all other ancient Laws have periſhed, but is the ſole ſurviving Law at this time. The preſervation whereof is the more to be admired, if it be conſidered, how by the ſtormes and perſecutions of ſeveral ages, near it has been to be annihilated and quite ſuppreſt, as all other Laws beſides it have been. For as the affairs of State have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and as the Emperours themſelves have been vertuouſly or vitiouſly inclined, ſo has it fared with this ſtudy and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of it, and indeed after the ſame manner with all other kind of learning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julius Caeſar, Auguſtus, Tiberius, Claudius, Vespaſian, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan, Adrian, Antonius Pius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, <hi>Alexander Severus, Conſtantine, Theodoſius,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> that were Emperours vigilant and induſtrious for the proſperity and weale of the Empire, and deſigned nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves but actions of vertue and honour; &amp; well knowing that their true intereſt lay in the maintaining of the Laws and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100164:66"/>government, without which all things muſt needs run haſtily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorder and confuſion; they had the Lawyers of their times in higheſt eſteem, preferring them to the publick offices of State, both of honour and juſtice; and admitting them into their ſecreteſt and moſt important counſels, and ſeldome was any Law made, to which they were not call'd to give their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and adviſe: Inſomuch as it is written of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> one of the before named Emperours, that he never eſtabliſhed any Law without the preſence and aſſiſtance of twenty of the moſt renowned Lawyers, and fifty other moſt judicious and acute men.<note n="a" place="margin">Baldwin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legom. ju.

                     </p>
                     <p>But there were others that ſate in the Empire of a far different nature and diſpoſition, who diſdaining that their will, how vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and lewd ſoever, ſhould be circumſcribed within the bounds of any Law; and eſteeming it a diſhonour, that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, who were but private men, ſhould undertake to adviſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or that any thing ſhould be done in State, but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abſolutely commanded; ſome of them deſpiſed the whole Law, and ſlighted thoſe that taught it; others proceeded ſo far in cruelty, as to baniſh ſome, and to put other Lawyers to death; for ſo did <hi>Nero, Commodus, Caracalla, Heliogabalus, Septimius Severus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to perſecute and take away their perſons did not ſatisfie the fury of ſome implacable Emperours, ſince others did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſtill in their room. Therefore it was thought neceſſary by ſome, that the Law it ſelf ſhould be ſo diſpatch'd, as it might be ſure it ſhould never renew or riſe again.<note n="b" place="margin">Annae.

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Caligula</hi> therefore put on a more hardy but a moſt barbarous reſolution, to burn all the books of the Law that were then extant; pretending that equity would run clearer, and juſtice be quicker, where the niceties and perplexities of the Law were gone. <hi>Sed non fuit tam diuturnum ejus imperium, ut efficere potuerit quae medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabatur; nec paſſus eſt Deus rata eſſe hujus tyranni impia &amp; rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae pernicioſa conſilia;</hi> But his reign did not endure ſo long as to execute what he did intend; neither would God ſuffer the deſign of this tyrant, that was ſo deteſtable in it ſelf, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Common-wealth, to be brought to paſs, ſayes <hi>Baldwine</hi> in his <hi>Prolegomena.</hi> Notwithſtanding how odious
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100164:67"/>ſoever this intendment was, and though it proved ineffectual in <hi>Caligula,</hi> yet did <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour attempt to do the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing; but God would not ſuffer ſuch a barbarous act to be done by him neither, ſayes the ſame <hi>Baldwine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that as often as it is call'd to mind, what extremities fell upon the Lawyers in the ſufferances of their perſons, and how near the whole body of the Law it ſelf was to be ſwallowed up and at once devoured, and that from no forreign enemy, but from the Roman Emperours themſelves, who ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected both; it muſt alſo be remembred, that thoſe Emperours were ſuch, whoſe actions are hated and abhorred by all that read them, and themſelves ſtigmatized for cruel and unnatural tyrants, and eſteemed rather Monſters then Men. Let it be conſidered alſo, that they did it to make way for their unbridled and tyrannical wills, which they thought might be more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, when there was neither perſon nor Law left to awe them. And let it withall be ſpoken to the eternal honour of that Law, that it ſtood flouriſhing notwithſtanding, after ſo many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had vainly attempted to throw it down.</p>
                     <p>But never was it ſo near to utter extirpation, as when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined ſtrength of barbarous people over-ran the Weſtern part of the Empire: For we read, that in leſs time then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of eighty years, <hi>Italy</hi> (though anciently the ſtrength and ſeat of that Empire) was ſeven times brought almoſt unto deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by the fire and ſword of the Barbarians, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, by <hi>Alarick</hi> King of the Gothes, who ſack'd <hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> and other places. Secondly, By <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> who razed <hi>Florence,</hi> waſted <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and not without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was diverted from the ſpoil of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the interceſſion of Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> Thirdly, by <hi>Genſericus</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who alſo had the ſackage of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Fourthly, by <hi>Biorgus</hi> King of the <hi>Alani,</hi> in the time of the Emperour <hi>Majoranus.</hi> Fifthly, by <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of the <hi>Heruli,</hi> who drove <hi>Augustulus</hi> the laſt Weſtern Emperour out of his eſtate, and twice in thirteen years laid the Countrey deſolate. Sixthly, by <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> called in by <hi>Zeno</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to expel <hi>Odoacer</hi> and the <hi>Heruli.</hi> And ſeventhly, by <hi>Gundebald</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who having ranſack'd all <hi>Lombardy,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100164:67"/>home again, leaving poſſeſſion to the <hi>Gothes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when the <hi>Gothes</hi> had reigned in <hi>Italy</hi> under eight of their Kings for the ſpace of ſeventy two years, they were at laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> united once more to the Empire in the time of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> But <hi>Narſes</hi> having govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Italy</hi> about ſeventeen years, and being after ſuch good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice moſt deſpitefully uſed by <hi>Sophia</hi> the wife of the Emperour <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> in revenge opened the paſſages of the Countrey to <hi>Alboinus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> then poſſeſſed of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> who coming into <hi>Italy</hi> with their Wives and Children, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of all that Countrey which anciently was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Ciſalpine Galls,</hi> calling it by their own names <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardia,</hi> now corruptly <hi>Lombardy.</hi> And afterwards in proceſs of time they grew ſo mighty and ſpreading there, that there are reckoned no leſs then twenty three Kings of that line ſucceeding one another in <hi>Italy,</hi> and their Kingdome endured no leſs then 206 years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Italy</hi> therefore being thus rent from the Roman Empire, and the Imperial ſeat being quite carried out of the Weſt, and fixed in the Eaſt at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the power thereof came to be leſs feared, and other of the Roman provinces were likewiſe aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For <hi>France,</hi> after it had been long harraſſed by the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, firſt of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and then of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards invaded and quite poſſeſſed by the <hi>Franks;</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long hovered on the banks of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> at laſt took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the diſtractions of the Empire, and ventured over the River under the conduct of their firſt King <hi>Pharamond,</hi> and quite expelled the Romans, and laid ſuch a ſtrong foundation of government there, that they have in a conſtant and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion continued there ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spain</hi> did not long remain in ſubjection to the Romans nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of which they were driven by the Gothes alſo, who kept the quiet poſſeſſion thereof very near three hundred years, till the Moors and Sarracens diſpoſſeſſed them; who there reigned full ſeven hundred years.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Germany,</hi> it was never wholly ſubdued by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but what they had gained thereof, the French, <hi>Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Almans,</hi> and other Dutch Nations took from them: till

                     <p>Thus the Roman Empire being rent in ſunder, it is eaſie to imagine, that the Roman Laws which conſtantly attended the Romans whereever they went, were alſo diſſipated in the ſame tempeſt; Laws and Government being like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins, they laugh and cry, live and die together: For Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours never think their Conqueſts perfect, till they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the ancient Government, Laws, and Cuſtomes, and have put all into a new mould after their own way. Neither is a people throughly brought under ſubjection to their new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, till they have utterly renounced all that was preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them by their former Rulers: Nor is the danger of their revolting quite over, till they have quite forgotten their firſt condition, and till a total change is made of Laws, Cuſtomes, Habit, and Language.

                     <p>Which torrent oſ ruine then happening, was the more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and fatal, in regard through <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Europaean</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being thus infeſted, that which is the Roman Civil Law now, and was collected and put together by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf, and doth bear his name (though ſelected out of a great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed maſs, conſiſting of near two thouſand Volumes, that had been 1400 years a laying together by ſeveral Lawyers) could not have any place then in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor could ever get entrance into thoſe parts for 500 years together after the death of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian:</hi> Becauſe this body of the Law that is now extant, was compiled and put together at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after the Roman Emperours had removed themſelves thither, and kept out of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Weſtern part of the Empire for all that time that thoſe Barbarians were poſſeſſed of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit it is no leſs certain, that the ancient Civil Law that was in being long before <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time, and that very frame and model thereof which was drawn together and raiſed out of thoſe ancient foundations by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf, was the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and ruling Law at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and all over the Eaſt, where the Roman Empire then was, and was tranſlated into the Greek tongue for the uſe of the people, and there continued flouriſhing at that time when the Weſt would not admit it. So that it is to be noted, that when it was driven or kept out, it was by a barbarous people that followed all with fire and ſword; and that it did not ſuffer alone, but all civility and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was baniſh'd with it too: and that it was never ſo extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from off the earth, but it had a being and continuance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                     <p>And yet there was a part of <hi>Italie</hi> alſo, namely the Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> conſiſting of ten Cities with the territories belonging to them, which the barbarous people could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, nor make them change their governours, government, or

                     <p>Notwithſtanding, it cannot be truly affirmed neither, that even thoſe parts of <hi>Italie</hi> which the Romans had quite loſt, and were made ſubject to this barbarous people, were totally guided by another Law, and had none of the Roman Law to guide them.</p>

                     <p>And <hi>Alarick</hi> the ſecond, one of the Gothiſh Kings, was ſo affected towards the Roman Laws, that in the year 506, he employed his own Chancellour <hi>Anianus</hi> to make a Collection out of the ſeveral parts of the Roman Laws, whereof the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſian Code was the chief, and to write Notes and Expoſitions upon it; which after he had done, it was publiſhed and ſet forth to be obſerved as Law in <hi>France.</hi> And Mr <hi>Selden</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note n="e" place="margin">Diſſert. ad Flet. ca. <hi>5.</hi> parag. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> that the ſame King did the like in <hi>Spain</hi> too as well as in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that albeit ruine, devaſtation, and violence had buried all that was Roman beſides; and for the better and more ſure kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of what was gotten, clean another government and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law was alſo ſetled; yet the Roman Law, either out of neceſſity, becauſe they ſaw the hearts of that people ſo ſet upon that Law, that they would never have remained quiet or peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without it, or out of ſome good eſteeme that ſuch a wilde and barbarous people bore to it themſelves, finding it to be ſo wiſe, ſolid, and rational, was ſtill retained in ſome uſe in <hi>Italy, France, Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> too, as the ſame Mr <hi>Selden</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, amidſt its very enemies; though much diminiſhed, corrected, and controuled by their own ſupereminent and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Law. So good a piece of policy, and ſuch a ſpecial mark of wiſdome was it then accounted, to have two Laws in the ſame Territory; the one of the Romans for private matters between man and man, for which it was ſo ſufficient, full, and equal; the other of their own, to direct and ſteer the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick upon all accidents, which they meant ſhould ſuperintend and reign in chief over and above the other.</p>
                     <p>But further, not onely the uſe, practiſe, and obſervation of the Roman Law has been in danger to be quite loſt and wholly ſet aſide, but the very books and writings of the Law have run very hard fates alſo; <hi>ut mirum ſit vel has qualeſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que juris Romani reliquias ſupereſſe,</hi> ſayes <hi>Baldwine</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena;</hi> that it may be admired we have ſuch parcels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                     <p>Queſtionleſs had they been preſerved, and tranſmitted unto poſterity entire, they would have acquainted us with much more of the Roman Antiquities then we now know; the Civil Law that we have, would have been much better underſtood, when we might have gone to the Original from whence it came; and the contradictions now contended about ſo much, would have been eaſily reconciled.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſe of this loſs did caſt <hi>Sabinus Floridus,</hi> who charges it upon <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> into ſuch an extaſie of indignation, that he ſayes, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> died mad with the conſciouſneſs and horrour of ſuppreſſing theſe books, and judges him not worthy ever to have been born. But <hi>Franciſcus Philelphus</hi> goes a ſtrain higher, plainly imprecating in this manner:

                     <p>Thus has it fared with the very books and writings of the Civil Law; but ſuch has been the providence of the Almighty in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this neceſſary piece of learning, that neither any nor all of theſe diſaſters have been powerful enough to extinguiſh it.

                     <p>And indeed the ſame and reputation of them ſo ſpread, all kind of learning reviving with it at the ſame time, that in a little ſpace of time it got footing alſo with the other ſciences in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and in all the Weſtern part of <hi>Europe,</hi> where it has been in greateſt uſe and higheſt account, as well in ſtudies as in Judicatories, ever ſince to this very age of ours.

Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the third for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the reading or teaching of the Civil Law in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1220.<note n="i" place="margin">Ca. ſuper spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta. ext. de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileg.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe Popes thought that the reſtraint of the Imperial Law, would be a ready means to bring into requeſt the Canon Law, which was as it were but new ſet up. Upon deſign therefore to bring into credith their own Eccleſiaſtical Law, rather then out of any diſlike of the Civil, were thoſe prohibitorie Decrees made; however they very much failed of that effect that was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: for we may have obſerved to this very time, that all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100164:72"/>thoſe Chriſtian States that do acknowledge the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power, have ſo equally divided their reſpect between both thoſe Laws, that they have appointed to each their proper function; deſigning the one to be ſerviceable to Civil matters, the other to Eccleſiaſtical; and ſo by ſuch moderation have done very equal right to both. At the ſame time that the Civil Law was publickly read at <hi>Bononia</hi> by the means of <hi>Lotharius</hi> the ſecond, it was brought into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Theobald</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and being publickly read in <hi>Oxford</hi> by <hi>Vacarius,</hi> it grew ſo general a ſtudy, and other learning was ſo much neglected upon it, that King <hi>Stephen</hi> incenſed thereat, ſent forth a peremptory command, that it ſhould be read in <hi>England</hi> no more, that <hi>Vacarius</hi> ſhould forbear to teach it any further, nor that it ſhould be lawful for any to keep any books of the Roman Laws by them: <hi>Sed parùm va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit Stephani prohibitio; nam eò magis invaluit virtus legis, Deo favente, quò eam amplius nitebatur impietas ſubvertere,</hi> ſayes Mr <hi>Selden;</hi>

                        </note> But King <hi>Stephens</hi> prohibition did prevaile but little; for the power of the Law, God proſpering the ſame, waxed the more vigorous, when malice did moſt ſtrive to deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by ſending forth their Edicts forbid the Civil Law to be taught in <hi>Paris,</hi> or that any Degrees ſhould be taken in that faculty. <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> anciently, did ſtraitly charge, that no man ſhould dare in any pleading to urge or cite the Roman Law againſt a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law of the Nation. In <hi>Spaine</hi> it has been made no leſs then a capital crime, to offer or alledge the Roman Law, as compulſive or binding.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely it is a high indignity to any Prince, to have any forreigne Law ſet up againſt, and to beat down his own. And therefore in the erection of Univerſities in <hi>France,</hi> the Kings have alwayes declared, that their purpoſe was to have the Civil and Canon Laws in them publickly profeſſed and taught, to make uſe thereof at their diſcretion, but not that the ſubjects ſhould be any way bound thereunto, leſt they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100164:73"/>ſhould ſeem to derogate from the Laws of their own countrey, by advancing the Laws of ſtrangers.<note n="l" place="margin">Bodin. de rep. lib. <hi>1.</hi> ca. <hi>8.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like edicts &amp; declarations of Princes, have been alwayes of full force and power, as moſt juſtly they ought to be, to limit the vaſt and univerſal power of the Civil Law, and to keep it from getting above and prevailing over the Laws and Cuſtomes of their own Territories; for that were no leſs then to worſhip two Suns in one and the ſame firmament, and to call in the Roman Sovereignty, which was long ago caſt off. But that the Civil Law ſhould not be ſtudied, publickly taught, no degrees taken in it, nor cited in their Judicatories in a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial and ſubordinate way to their own municipal Laws and Cuſtomes, or that it ſhould not be admitted to teach us true equity and ſound reaſon, their reſtraining Edicts never have ſo far prevailed ſo totally to ſuppreſs it, from the time of <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the ſecond, the firſt reſtorer and reeſtabliſher of it, to this preſent, which is now full 500 years. <hi>Plurimùm diſtat lex à jure,</hi> ſayes the ſame Bodine; <hi>Jus enim ſine juſſu ad id quod aequum bonumque est; lex autem a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>That Forreigne Nations in doing of Right between Man and Man, do mainly practiſe and make uſe of the Rules and dictates of the Civil Law.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THat the Roman Civil Law, framed ſo many hundred years ago, and deviſed for the uſe of one Nation onely, is ſtill extant and in being at this day, the ſtate it ſelf being quite extinct; poſſibly it may not ſeem commendation and praiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, except the uſe, practiſe, and obſervation of it up and down divers great Nations of the World be alſo ſhewed. The next thing therefore that we have to ſay in further praiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that the greateſt and beſt ordered Nations, though they manage their publick occaſions and affaires of State by rules and directions of their own ordaining, having an eye to the nature of their people, way of government, and preſent exigencies onely; yet in the diſpenſation of private juſtice, and in pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the debates and differences that do ariſe between their ſubjects, where meer right and equity onely is conſiderable, they uſe and practiſe the rules and principles of the Civil Law chiefly.</p>
                     <p>Peculiar Statutes, Ordinances, Cuſtomes, and municipal Laws every State has of its own making, which in the regulation of its proper affairs it does prefer before any other Laws or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions whatſoever, though in reaſon and convenience they may ſeem much better. Yet humane occurences are ſo many in number, and in circumſtances ſo greatly differing one from the other, that no Nation is perfectly ſupplied with Laws of their own to anſwer them, but that there is ſtill need of ſome ſubſidiary Law, more univerſal and comprehenſive then its own.</p>
                     <p>And from this ground is it, that moſt States have entertained the Imperial Law, to ſupply and aſſiſt where their own is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100164:74"/>making their ſtudy and ſcience of Law to conſiſt in that, but the uſe and exerciſe thereof to be reſtrained and bounded by their own proper Laws, which every Nation requires to have firſt known, and chiefly to be obſerved. Wherefore if you tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into their States, and ſhall aſcend up into their Courts and places of Judicature, both Judges and Advocates will be every where found to be all Civilians and Graduates in that faculty; &amp; the proceedings in cauſes there, to be moſt after the form and manner of the Civil Law. And when any caſe comes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by final ſentence, if there be any proper or peculiar Law of their own Countrey to determine it, judgment paſſes, as that ſpecial Law directeth; but if that be wanting, as commonly it is, preſently recourſe is had to the Civil Law, and by that is it both pleaded and judged.</p>
                     <p>Which becauſe it ſhews the tranſcendent excellency of this Law, being incident to no other Law beſides, and being not throughly enquired into, may ſeem incredible to many men, it is therefore a point worthy of a ſtrict examination, and fit to be fully cleared and perfectly underſtood.</p>
                     <p>For peradventure it may not paſs without a wonder, that a Prince or Common-wealth ſhould not be able to manage their rule and government by Laws of their own deviſing; or that any differences ſhould ariſe amongſt their people, which they knew not how to decide of themſelves, but muſt conſult with the oracles of other Nations.</p>
                     <p>It eclipſes, ſome may think, the Majeſty of a State, to have rules preſcrib'd to it by others. And ſince the time that a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Kingdomes was firſt made, and each had their bounds ſet them, no Potentate, no not the Emperour himſelf has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a power to give Law to any, but to ſuch as have been his ſubjects by birth, habitation, or conqueſt. Neither can Lawes be made to regulate the whole World, or to bind all people, ſayes <hi>Suarez.</hi>

                        </note> The Laws that were proper for the Romans, ſuit not ſo well with others; the manner of living is not now as it then was, the ſtate of affairs is clean changed, climates differ, and the tempers of people differ
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100164:75"/>too; new and ſtrange accidents do frequently ariſe, which will require new conſtitutions to ſettle them; the form of governing is divers in ſeveral times &amp; places, the Laws therfore cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be the ſame; Monarchical Laws are of no uſe to a Popular government; and Popular Laws do not fit a Monarchical State: Severe edicts will not ſuit with a milde and gentle people; and contrariwiſe, barbarous or untractable natures muſt not be dealt withall by gentleneſs or clemency. It may therefore be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, how the Civil Law that was made ſo many hundred years ago, and for one ſingle Nation, can be accomodated to other Nations, coming in ſo long a tract of time after them, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from them in habit, language, ſituation, manners, and form of government.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, to hear of the general uſe of the Civil Law in forreign parts, is ſo odious and offenſive a thing to ſome humorous Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilians, that although they be ſo learned, that they muſt needs know it to be true, and having travailed abroad muſt needs have ſeen it; yet to take away all belief thereof from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation, leſt they ſhould look too favourably upon it, they do too frequently ſuggeſt in their writings, That in <hi>France</hi> it has been forbidden under a penalty to read the Civil Law to any publick audience, and thoſe that ſhould hear the ſame read, were alſo to undergo the ſame puniſhment; And that in <hi>Spain</hi> to cite the authority of the Civil Law in Court, has been made an offence no leſs then capital. But they do not add withall (which they know they may as truly) that theſe ſharp edicts laſted not long, but grew out of uſe very long ago; and that the Civil Law does flouriſh no where ſo much as in thoſe two great Monarchies, and ſo has done for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and have both ſent forth men as famous and renowned in that profeſſion as in any other; of whom mention ſhall be made hereafter. For both the ſtudy and practice of the Civil Law has been found of ſuch abſolute uſe and neceſſity, that thoſe States that have been brought upon ſome pretence of convenience to ſuppreſs it, have been glad after ſome little want thereof to reeſtabliſh it and ſet it up again.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall not travail any further to cite any more forreign teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to prove that this Law is generally received and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by other Nations; and the rather, becauſe Dr <hi>Duck</hi> in his book, has by variety of proof ſo ſufficiently made it good already. But yet it is worth the ſetting down, what ſome of our own Countrey-men have in their writings acknowledg'd to the very ſame purpoſe; and thoſe eſpecially amongſt the reſt, whoſe intereſt and high valuation which they paſs upon the Laws of their own Countrey, will not permit them to aſcribe more to the Civil Law, then the juſt truth will bear.</p>
                     <p>And it is moſt obſervable, what King <hi>James</hi> himſelf, the learnedeſt of all modern Princes, ſaid here in a Speech made to no leſs ſolemn aſſembly, then his Lords and Commons of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note n="u" place="margin">21. <hi>Martii</hi> 1609.</note> which we have extant amongſt his printed works. <q>As a King, ſaith he, I have leaſt cauſe of any man to diſlike the Common-Law; for no Law can be more favourable and advantagious for a King, and extendeth further his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then it doth. And for a King of <hi>England</hi> to deſpiſe the the Common-Law, it is to neglect his own Crown. Yet, ſaith he, I do greatly eſteem the Civil Law, the profeſſion thereof ſerving more for general learning, and being moſt neceſſary for matters of Treaty with all forreign Nations. And I think, that if it ſhould be taken away, it would make an entry to Barbariſme in this Kingdome, and would blemiſh the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>England;</hi> for it is in a manner <hi>lex Gentium,</hi> and maintaineth entercourſe with all forreign Nations.

                     <p>And in another ſpeech in Star-chamber,<note n="x" place="margin">20 <hi>Iun.</hi> 1616.</note> printed alſo; <q>God forbid, ſaith he, the Law of Nations (intending thereby chiefly the Civil Law) ſhould be barred in this Kingdome, and that for two cauſes; one, becauſe it is a Law to ſatisfie ſtrangers, which will not hold themſelves ſo well ſatisfied with other municipal Laws; another, to ſatisfie our own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in matters of Piracy, Marriage, Wills, and things of like nature.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, when he was ſo mightily preſſing to have had an union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> under the ſame policy of Laws, as they had but one and the ſame King; in a ſpeech made upon that ſubject,<note n="y" place="margin">Ult. Mart. <hi>1607.</hi>
                        </note> extant in his printed works, he told his two Houſes of Parliament, that in point of conjunction of Nations, the Civil Law ought to bear a great ſway, it being the Law of Nations. Theſe are the expreſſions of a King, the intereſt of whoſe Crown and Scepter, and the prerogatives thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing did depend upon the favour of another Law; and yet he poſitively and in down-right termes in the face of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, avows the Civil Law to be the Law of Nations; and that all tranſactions of Treaty and of Trade with forreign Nations were diſpatched by the rule and reaſon thereof; and that the authority thereof was ſo great in the eſteem of ſtrangers, that they would reſt ſatisfied therewith, when no municipal Law could ſatisfie them. But in that he avers alſo, that when the people of <hi>England</hi> ſhall exterminate that Law, (which muſt needs be when the practice thereof is quite taken away or thruſt into a poor narrow compaſs) their honour will be obſcured, and they will be in danger to be over-run with barbariſme; it was never ſo well worth the obſerving, as at this preſent time. And it clearly ſhews, that wiſe and learned King did perfectly underſtand the true uſe of the Civil Law; for as the language
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100164:77"/>thereof muſt needs be a means to maintain learning, which does civilize &amp; ſoften the minds of men; ſo there is no ſort of learning with the which the matter of it does not correſpond and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; but above all it does afford more and better rules for civil living and orderly converſation amongſt men, and for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing each with other, then any other ſtudy or learning whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>But this practiſe and uſage of the Civil Law in forreign parts is yet better confirmed by the authority of thoſe, who ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profeſſing the Law of <hi>England,</hi> have been alwayes jealous of the riſing and growth of the Civil Law in this Nation. For though they have deſired to keep it low here (for what reaſon I need not mention) yet ſome of them have freely enough owned, how much it is in uſe and practiſe in other Countreys.</p>

And as for other Chriſtian States, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no ſuperiour, or any ſubjection to the Empire, as <hi>France, Spain, Denmark, Poland,</hi> the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> and what alſo in <hi>Germany</hi> hath made it ſelf free from the Empire, though as it is Law, he will not have it to binde or rule with them; yet he ſaith, in all of them, the reaſon of it brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to method, is uſed and applied commonly to argument, when any of their cuſtomes or ſtatutes come in queſtion; becauſe the practiſers ſtudied it in the Univerſities, and had thence their degrees given them.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Civilians themſelves do not enlarge the uſe and practiſe of the Civil Law in forreign parts, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Mr <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf in his writings grants it to extend.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom what has been cited out of Mr <hi>Selden,</hi> it does appear, that there is as much granted by Mr <hi>Selden</hi> to the Civil Law, as ever was challenged by any Civilian, or ever aſcribed to it by any, or that any can wiſh to be granted to that profeſſion in any Nation.</p>
                     <p>He in effect acknowledgeth, that when the uſe thereof came to be renewed in <hi>Europe</hi> with other learning, it was found to be ſo rich a Treaſury of reaſon, judgment, and true natural equity; and ſo uſeful for all matters that reſpected Civil ſociety and government, that by the knowledge and direction of the Civil Law, and the rules and principles thereof they knew how to ſupply with reſolution ſuch caſes, as their National Laws had not made any proviſion at all in; or if they had, but were dark or intricate, this would help to explain and illuſtrate them; which neither common reaſon nor any other humane learning would enable them to do. The Univerſities have therefore ſince made it their common ſtudy, and commonly given
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100164:80"/>degrees in it, and have ſent forth the profeſſours thereof into all Tribunals to be the minſters of right and juſtice there; till now at laſt it is grown to be a common profeſſion throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> And though the original authority which it had in the Roman State, is quite worn out, no State being now ſubject to the Roman Sovereignty; yet Mr <hi>Selden</hi> does admit it to be entertained for a binding Law by ordinance in ſome places, that ſtamp that authority upon it which of it ſelf it hath not; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uſually obſerved as a Law by cuſtome and practiſe; but where it paſſes not for Law neither way, there the reaſon and wiſdome thereof prevailes, and every man ſuffers himſelf to be convinced thereby, <hi>non vi neceſſitatis ſed vi rationis,</hi> not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the will, as a Law does, but as by reaſon powerfully work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, and at laſt controuling the underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Thus far goes Mr <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf; and by no Civilian has a greater latitude then this been ever given to the Civil Law. For what King <hi>James</hi> ſpake to his Parliament in the year 1609, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter; That there was no Kingdome in the World, not onely <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>Spain,</hi> nor any other Kingdome governed meerly by the Civil Law, but every one of them hath their own Municipal Laws agreeable to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as this Kingdome hath the Common-Law; we all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly own to be true.</p>
                     <p>And what he told them of <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular, in the year 1607. may be as well and as truly ſpoken of all the States in <hi>Europe.</hi> If a man, ſaith he, plead there, that the Law of the Nation is otherwiſe, it is a bar to the Civil; and a good Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour or Preſident will oftentimes repel and put to ſilence an argument that the Lawyers bring out of the Civil Law, where they have a clear ſolution in their own Law. So as, ſaith he, the Civil Law in <hi>Scotland</hi> is admitted in no other caſes, but to ſupply ſuch caſes, wherein the Municipal Law is defective. This is generally reported by others, never queſtioned by our ſelves: For we are of opinion, there is no people in the World govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſingly by any one kind of Law whatſoever, nor indeed can be; much leſs can any State be totally governed by the Roman Law, but that there muſt needs be a ſuperadded and a peculiar Law, eſpecially as to government, ſuiting with the climate it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100164:80"/>ſelf, the nature and manners of the people, the faſhion and form of publick actions, divers accidents of the time, and ſundry other occurrences. Nay, we often ſee it fall out, that ſome certain Laws that are ſpecially made for a people, and at their firſt ordaining are found to be moſt excellent and very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws; yet in proceſs of time through alteration of things, and the very perſons themſelves for which they were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, it is as great wiſdome and as neceſſary to change them and quite take them away, as it was at firſt to deviſe them. It is no wonder therefore, that divers parts of the Civil Law, that were accommodated to the nature of the Roman people onely, and the uſages then in being, ſhould prove incongruous to the men and to the affaires of this preſent world, which is of a clean different face and nature. For inſtance:</p>
                     <p>A Roman ſubject was not ſuch a ſupreme moderator amongſt his Children, nor ſuch a free diſpoſer of his own eſtate, as that he could make his Will thereof, as he pleaſed, preferring one childe, and excluding another, or parting it too unequally amongſt them, or gratifying ſome ſtranger without remembring any of them.</p>
                     <p>If therefore a childe were quite left out of his fathers Will, or were eſpecially diſinherited, but without any cauſe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or upon ſuch a cauſe as the Law did not allow of, or if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a legal cauſe, yet not ſuch as was true in fact, the Will was void and null.<note n="e" place="margin">Weſemb. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

                     <p>But by the Civil Law it is not onely theft, privily to take and carry away ſomething that is anothers with an intent to defraud him of it; but it is a theft alſo, when one that has lent money upon a Pawn does employ the pawn to any private uſe of his own; or when one that is intruſted with the ſafe keeping of any thing for me, does uſe or wear it himſelf; or when one has bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed a thing of me for a certain uſe, and he does otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, or for a certain time, and he detains it longer, or carries it whither he ſhould not, and further then he promiſed to do.<note n="l" place="margin">L.

                     <argument>
                        <p>No Municipal Law is ſufficient to meet with the multitude and variety of caſes and queſtions that will happen at Land, at Sea, and in forreign parts: Which has cauſed ſo many Nations to make uſe of the Civil Law, where it is proper and pertinent to their affairs, to joyn with and help their own; rather then to be without any Law at all, and to be ſubject to the miſchiefs of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarineſs, folly, and violence.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is the practiſe of the whole world to adhere and ſtand to the dictates of their own Laws, and in no caſe to admit of any other Rule, either of Civil Law, or acuteſt reaſon againſt that which their own National Laws have declared and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done.<note n="r" place="margin">Nec judicibus contra leges ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare, nec de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus in republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca probatis ac ſuſceptis dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare fas eſt. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. de rep. lib. 1. ca. 10. in fin.</hi>
                        </note> But then it is viſible to every diſcerning eye, that the Laws that are made, are oft times drawn ſo ſhort, and put into ſuch obſcure and ambiguous termes, that it is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſome other Law or rule ſhould be found out to ſupply, clear, and explain them. And every where the body of the Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal conſtitutions appears ſo narrow and ſlender, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends ſo little, that the number of caſes that are expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by Law, is not by many degrees comparable to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, that do frequently and almoſt daily happen, wherein the Law of the Nation has not made any deciſion at all.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> in his Preface to the Iriſh Reports, does not ſtick to acknowledge this to be moſt true in the Municipal Law of <hi>England,</hi> though in his praiſes of it he ſets it above all the Laws of the World beſides. For, ſaith he, if the Rules and Maximes of the Law were a thouſand times as many as they be indeed, yet would they carry no proportion with the infinite diverſitie of mens actions, and of other accidents, which make the caſes that are to be decided by the Law. How great need is there therefore to keep the Civil Law in <hi>England</hi> ſtill, that out of its
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100164:82"/>ſtore and plenty it may be inſtrumental to reſolve thoſe doubts and queſtions of right, which as yet have no ſpecial Law of the Nation made for them?</p>
                     <p>Indeed as the humours and inclinations of men do differ, and their occaſions are divers, and the ends they purſue, various, and the way and courſe they take to obtain them, not the ſame; ſo is it impoſſible, that the actions that proceed from them, ſhould be like and uniform, but muſt needs, as their cauſes are, be various and diſagreeing: From whence it happens, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day produces ſuch accidents, as though they be not wholly new, yet they come accompanied with one circumſtance or other, that makes them differ from all that went before them. Beſides, Nature it ſelf brings forth ſome variety of contingents without any act of man.</p>
                     <p>All which being of ſeveral natures, and differently circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated from what is paſt or could be thought of, though they do too frequently happen and intermix with the affaires of men, yet to ſupply them with a direct peculiar Law, or any other expreſs and determinate rule to ſettle them, is an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that was never undertaken by the wiſeſt Law-givers that have been;<note n="s" place="margin">Legiſlator non poteſt omnia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarare, quia res in quibus verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſunt prope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modùm infinitae; &amp; quia in hac vita mortali ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil eſt perfectum; &amp; propter ingenii imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus cuncta rimari.

                        </note> Theſe infinite varieties can in no Laws, no Tables, no Pandects, no Books, be they never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or ſo voluminous, be all of them contained or comprehended. And again,<note n="u" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>Non magis legibus ſingula contineri poſſunt, quàm infinitum quiddam &amp; immenſum ab eo quod finibus exiguis, ac veluti cancellis anguſtiſſimis concluſum eſt,</hi> ſayes the ſame <hi>Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> No eaſier is it to collect all the ſeveral caſes into one book of Laws, then to comprehend that which is in greatneſs infinite, in that which lies in a moſt narrow compaſs, and is as it were in ſtraiteſt bounds ſhut up. And yet ſince there is a neceſſity of ſetling ſuch various and ſo unlike contingencies, ſome rational way or rule muſt be found out whereby to compoſe and ſettle
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100164:83"/>them, left they ſhould be made ſubject to meer will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or in default of better means, men intereſted therein ſhould be left to right themſelves by forcible and violent wayes.</p>
                     <p>It is no leſs evident and manifeſt, that whileſt we have to deal with forreign States, as ordinarily we do in the way of trade and commerce, and too frequently in the way of War too, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and controverſies without number do ariſe, ſome whereof do concern &amp; reflect upon the States themſelves, as being of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick concernment; others be of a more private nature, and do concern the intereſt of ſome ſubjects onely. But when ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of either kind do happen, is there any Municipal Law capable to decide them? ſhould we not as much diſdain to be judg'd by the Law of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> when we have to do with them, as they would to be over-ruled by ours, when they have to do with us? Nay, ſhould we not abandon the ſociety of ſuch a Nation, that ſhould tie us to their own Laws, in matters that are tranſacted and done out of their proper Territorie, as happily upon the open Sea, or in the Territory of another Prince and people? Of what force or power can a Law be to thoſe who are not ſubject to the authority of thoſe that make it<note n="w" place="margin">Ubi ceſſat ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entium, ſtatuti diſpoſitio non obtinet. <hi>l. fin.

                        </note>? And yet when we fall into their hands, and controverſies are moved againſt us in their Tribunals, we muſt inevitably ſtand to and abide their juſtice, and the like they owe to ours: But then right muſt be done by ſuch rules and principles, as both ſides may be fully ſatisfied in the equity of them.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore does appear the true uſe of the Civil Law, and the ground whereupon all Nations have admitted it into their Courts and acts of juſtice: For although it cannot be ſaid, that there is no caſe which is not contained in the Roman Law: <hi>Neque leges neque ſenatuſconſulta ita ſcribi poſſunt, ut omnes caſus qui quandoque inciderint, comprehendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; ſed ſufficit, &amp; ea quae plerunque accidunt, contineri;</hi> ſayes the Civil Law it ſelf:<note n="x" place="margin">L. <hi>10.</hi> Dig. De legib.</note> Neither Laws nor reſults of Council can be ſo ſufficiently framed, as to provide for all caſes that ſhall happen hereafter; but it may ſuffice, if ſuch caſes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, as in contingency are moſt familiar and common: yet ſuch is the copiouſneſs of that Law, beyond any that has yet been; and ſuch a wonderful enlargement has been made
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100164:83"/>thereof by the profeſſours of it in all ages ever ſince, as caſes and accidents of all ſorts and natures, and in all Countreys, have happened from time to time, from ſtudy, argument, and the ſeveral reſolutions of forreign Courts applied thereunto, and all upon the reaſon and equity of that Law which was written by the Romans; that now it may be juſtly thought, no caſe can fall out or accident ariſe, which the learning of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thus poliſhed and perfected, either in expreſs termes, or by parity of reaſon, will not determine. Wherefore it is upon juſt reaſon, and likewiſe upon neceſſity too, that ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have recourſe to the wiſdome and fulneſs of that Law thus amplified, as oft as their own particular conſtitutions fail them.</p>
                     <p>And although there are a ſort of men in the world (who indeed have ſome good natural abilities in them, as a ready apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a quick wit, a holding memory, and a ſmooth elocution, but were never brought up either in Law or any learning) yet they do much preſume upon that ordinary and common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they have, that they think, or at leaſt they would have the World believe ſo, whereby they may be thought worthy of the beſt places of Judicature, that they can by the ſtrength of their poor illiterate reaſon reſolve all queſtions and doubts of Law whatſoever, whether they ariſe at Land or at Sea; be they of publick concernment or of private; entrenching upon our own Law, or touching upon the Law of Nations; be the caſe between Prince and people; ſubject and ſtranger; one State and another; clear in Law or ambiguous; ſetled by expreſs conſtitution, or left undecided; yet their capacity, as they would have it conceived, without any ſuch help as the Civil Law, does ſuffice for all.</p>
                     <p>And yet when theſe preſumptuous and high conceited men do ſit to judge and adminiſter right on ſuch matters, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find what they would not before believe, or at leaſt not have believed by others, that their underſtanding is too narrow to comprehend ſuch difficult things, and their inſufficiency to be too great to determine them: and are therefore driven to conſult with the learned of that profeſſion, to whoſe skill it does belong, not without ſome ſhame to themſelves. And it were
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100164:84"/>to be wiſhed, that the onely effect of ſuch mens ambition and confidence might reſt there, and that it did no greater miſchief. But it commonly falls out to be fatal to the intereſt of many, which is taken away or prejudiced by their errour &amp; ignorance: and ſometime States alſo are embroyled in war and hoſtility each againſt other by their unskilful managery; <hi>Ignorantia judicis plerunque eſt calamit as innocentis,</hi> fayes St <hi>Auſtin;</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">De Civit. Dei. lib. <hi>19.</hi> ca. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Judge is frequently the woe of thoſe that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <p>And indeed though it be nothing elſe but reaſon, that does render a man capable and fitting to diſcuſs and pronounce upon ſuch queſtions, yet it is not the vulgar &amp; common reaſon that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does beſtow upon every man; but it is that reaſon which is gotten by art and ſtudy of the Law and of the rules &amp; principles of juſtice, and which is improved and inlightned by a continual uſe, and a long experience, and which in truth is to be found no where but in ſtudents, practiſers and Judges of the Civil Law onely.</p>
                     <p>And yet there has been a ſtrong conceit, taken up but lately, but yet very hotly purſued, to have the ſame take effect, by ſolliciting the ſtate to make a Law to that purpoſe; that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of old experienced Merchants are much fitter and better enabled to ſit upon the trial and examination of matters of forreign trade and negociation, and of buſineſs ariſing upon or beyond the Sea, then any ſtudents, graduats, or practiſers in the Civil Law whatſoever; ſuppoſing, that if the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty were turned into a Court of Merchants, both ſubjects and ſtrangers would be better ſatisfied, and trade go on and thrive much better.</p>
                     <p>Which project ſome Merchants have been the more embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to ſet on foot, becauſe they once prevailed ſo far, as to get an Act of Parliament to be made in the fourty third year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby all controverſies that ſhould from thenceforth ariſe upon any aſſurances made of any goods, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, ſhips, and things adventured, are committed to the hearing and trial of ſo many Judges, whereof the Civilians are feweſt, and the Merchants make the greateſt number. They would have it conceived, that none has underſtanding or skill
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100164:84"/>enough to judge of the my ſterie of their employment but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves onely; and that it is equity and a good conſcience, in a moſt ſummary and a compendious way, and not the intricate and long Maeanders of the Law, that is the fitteſt to arbitrate and decide their differences; crying out for a quick diſpatch, that their voyages to Sea may not be obſtructed. They are jealous withall, that the profeſſion of the Law is but a deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a company of men with the vexations and ſpoiles of others; grudging, that there ſhould be a diſtinct profeſſion made of the Law, which ſecures themſelves and all they have, when every Trade and Handicraft hath the like.</p>
                     <p>In which ſuggeſtions if there could be imagined to be any either truth or ſoundneſs, yet ſince the ſame may be made by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trades and profeſſions as well as by the Merchants; it would argue, that there were by the State too great care had of them, and too little had of others, to aſſign the Merchants onely Judges out of their own order, and not to grant the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to other Tradeſmen alſo. And yet to make a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion general, and to erect ſo many Tribunals as there are Trades and callings, was never as yet accuſtomed or put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by any Nation.</p>

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:100164:85"/>
                     <p>Beſides, it is moſt frequent and ordinary for a number of Merchants to joyn in copartnerſhip together, and to employ one common and joynt ſtock beyond the Seas, and yet few of the copartners known or taken notice of; ſo that it may happen, that a Merchant, that ſits on the judgment ſeat, may be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the caſe in queſtion, and be judge in his own caſe, and yet his intereſt not ſeen or diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>Again, there is ſuch a ſpirit of oppoſition reigns between the Merchant and the Mariner, who is as uſeful and ſerviceable at ſea as the Merchant can poſſibly pretend to be, that if the Merchant ſhould ſit to judge the Mariner, in time, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor Mariners might be ſo ſeverely dealt with, and kept with ſuch ſhort wages by the Merchant, at whoſe pleaſure and command he is, that he will not care to ſerve, and ſo naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be quite loſt.</p>
                     <p>Nay further, the controverſies in the Admiralty are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our own Merchants onely, but many times between our own and other Merchants of forreign Nations. Whereby, if ours were Judges, there would be given into their hands a great advantage to help and gratifie thoſe of their own Countrey and rank, and to oppreſs ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, what affinity is there between buying and ſelling, (which is the onely skill of the Merchant) and judging of the nature and right of contracts, injuries, debts, agreements, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and other accidents and emergencies happening upon the Sea or in forreign parts, which they ſo covet to gain unto themſelves? Which knowledge and faculty is not to be found in the depth of the Ocean, nor to be obtained by Travail, but is gotten by ſerious contemplation and a long ſtudy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the practiſe of a mans whole life.</p>
                     <p>I write not this to debaſe the true worth nor to leſſen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Merchants. They are a people that enrich the Nation as well as themſelves; and for the dangers they run through, both perſonal and real, they deſerve to have the higheſt immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities conferred on them. But let them keep within their own ſphear, and not aſpire to ſuch a function, which neither their breeding, capacity, or parts does enable them unto, nor their employment gives them leiſure to diſcharge.<note n="d" place="margin">Robert Rer. judicat. lib. <hi>2.</hi> ca. <hi>16.</hi>
                        </note> And therefore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100164:85"/>upon a ſolemn debate, whether Merchants ſhould be joyned to Civilians to try ſuch matters, it was denied, and judg'd againſt in <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1584.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, that it ſhould be thought that men (whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law and skill to do right and juſtice is no greater, then bare nature and their illiterate education has affoorded them) ſhould be able to do it quicker, and at leſs charge to thoſe that ſeek it, then thoſe that have made it their whole ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and employment, is to me an imagination ſtrange and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond belief; for unqueſtionably the skilful and expert Judge, that by his ſtudy and practiſe is accuſtomed to ſuch buſineſs, as he does beſt underſtand it, ſo he muſt needs ſooneſt diſpatch it alſo. Becauſe cuſtome and knowledge hath made all things of that nature obvious and eaſie to him; and ſuch a judge will not allow any thing to be ſpoken impertinently and beſide the matter in queſtion; and ſo a multitude of buſineſs goes off quickeſt under him, and both delay and much charge is avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when they come to judge thereof, who never medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated or dealt in ſuch things, it muſt needs be, that they muſt run into many impertinent queſtions, and that they muſt toyle and perplex themſelves to underſtand the true point in iſſue; meeting every where with knots and difficulties, and ſcarce any thing that is eaſie &amp; clear to them; wherby they cannot without long and frequent debates and much time ſpent reſolve any caſe in queſtion. And though it be rightly decided in the end, which it is twenty to one if it be, and is an act of chance rather then judgment; yet in a multitude of other buſineſs, before any comes to be judg'd, the attendance, I am ſure, is moſt tedious, and the charge intollerable: ſo that to put the Maritime and forreign affairs to be judg'd by Merchants, is to augment delay and charge, rather then to leſſen either.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, thoſe that ſtudy and profeſs onely the Law of their own Countrey, (which as I ſaid before, is commonly but of narrow extent, and ſerves but for a few particular occaſions onely) may be as juſtly deemed incapable to judge and ſit upon triall of ſuch matters (though they do concern the diſpenſing of Law and juſtice too) wherein the Municipal Law is ſilent, and has made no proviſion at all; or peradventure is not capable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100164:86"/>to make any determination in them; as when they fall out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the main and open Sea, or in a forreign State, or are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ariſing between two ſeveral Nations, or their ſubjects, to which no Municipal Law can be applied. In brief, where the Laws ſtand diſtinct, and the profeſſions thereof diſtinct alſo, the exerciſe of them ought not to be confounded by the ones thruſting into the others function and calling. And therefore much leſs reaſon have they to prohibit the Civilians, who have the knowledge, the triall of thoſe caſes; and aſſume it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who have it not.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon therefore we ſay it is, that though every Nation has Laws and Statutes of their own, proper for their affairs and people, and thoſe within their ſeveral confines, ſo far as they do preſcribe, have the preeminence above any other Law or reaſon in the world, as has been ſaid before: Yet there is no forreign Nation in the World, that has a diſtinct ſtudy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Municipal Law of the Nation, apart and divided from the Roman Civil Law: neither are there any where elſe ſtudents and profeſſours of any Municipal Law diſtinctly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and dignified, as there are in <hi>England.</hi> But the ſtudy and profeſſion of Law that is to be found in the other parts of the World, and is ſerviceable for the government of the Civil State, is the ſtudy and profeſsion of the Roman Civil Law onely.</p>
                     <p>All which, and whatſoever elſe we ſhall ſay hereafter to the ſame purpoſe, we would have underſtood as humble propoſals onely, to be conſidered of in order to a future ſettlement which we hope and long for. But if the Authority of this Nation (who beſt can judge what is fitteſt for the people, and what ſuits beſt with the preſent Government) ſhall in the end commit and diſpoſe of thoſe Trials which formerly did belong to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the Civil Law, into the hands of others, that do not partake of that excellent knowledge; it does behove all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſit down ſatisfied therewith, and to ſubmit unto it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any murmuring or diſputing; for I do greatly approve of that golden ſaying of the Civil Law.<note n="e" place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <argument>
                        <p>The reaſons are ſtrong and weighty, upon which ſo many forreign States do direct and order the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their Tribunals moſt by the praeſcript, reaſon, and equity of the Civil Law.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is from the Roman Civil Law that the ſtudents in forreign Nations do derive their firſt principles of Law and juſtice, and in this are all publick Lectures read and degrees taken, and not in any Municipal Law.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is true, that before they practiſe or ſit in places of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, they read and throughly inform themſelves in the Laws of their own Countrey; by which, where there is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and expreſs conſtitution in the point, their pleadings and judgments muſt be directed wholly. But in caſes where there is none, as the caſes be but few where there is, in compariſon of thoſe where there is not; or where that which is, is either in ſenſe ambiguous, or in words obſcure, and muſt be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or where no Municipal Law can be of any force or uſe at all, as in the caſes above ſpecified, there they generally make the Civil Law, or the reaſon thereof, their onely rule and guide, to adminiſter right and juſtice by both to their own people, and to forreigners alſo.</p>
                     <p>To this they are led by divers neceſſary and moſt important reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for them to do ſo, is but anſwerable to their education, as they are all Civilians, and to thoſe principles which their learning hath ingrafted in them: For ſince they have been bred and diſciplined under it, it is no wonder if their judgments and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100164:87"/>reſults be ſteered by it: it being natural, that waters ſhould have the true reliſh of the fountain from whence they flow. And therefore when the learned of that profeſſion ſate in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Judicatories of <hi>England,</hi> diſtribution of juſtice was ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame rules in ſuch caſes, wherein no ſpecial Law was, or could be made to guide them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it cannot be deviſed, how ſuch caſes as neither the Law nor the cuſtome of the place has ſpecially provided in, can be well underſtood, and receive a true and right judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of that profeſſion. All other learning beſides that is taken up in the conſideration of things that are clean of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature; and does not conſider what dealings there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, ſubjects and forreigners; and what ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity does require in each of them, as that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly doth.</p>
                     <p>As for vulgar and common reaſon, it is of uſe in matters that are obvious to ſenſe, and to the firſt apprehenſion, and which are miniſterial to the maintaining of life and livelyhood. But where the diſcurſive faculty muſt be employed, and great reaſoning and a long experience is required, as in the things we now ſpeak of, ordinary reaſon, if we preſume upon it, will ſooner lead us into errour, then be any advantage towards a ſolid and right judgment. Nay, ſo unable are the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to diſcern and judge of them, that it is uſual for the Judges of the Law themſelves to be at a ſtand, and to ſpend ſome time in ſtudy and counſel, ere they can reſolve ſome queſtions that do ariſe; ſo intricate and perplexed are they.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is the nature and practice of all States and people, beſides their own proper Laws, to uſe ſuch as are common to all other Nations and men, and ſo no ſtrange thing to cheriſh two Laws in one Common-wealth, as ſome do too vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. <hi>Omnes populi, qui legibus &amp; moribus reguntur, partim ſuo proprio, partim communi omnium hominum jure utuntur,</hi> ſayes <hi>Gaius:</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">L. <hi>9.</hi> Dig. De juſt. &amp; jur.</note> and <hi>Juſtinian:</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Parag. <hi>1.</hi> Inſt. Deju. nat. gent. &amp; civ.</note> All people that are guided by any Law or cuſtome at all, are guided by a Law common to others, as well as by that that is peculiar to themſelves; for if the Law of a Nation be not univerſal enough (as indeed none is) but that in the miniſtration of juſtice there will every day ariſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100164:87"/>ſuch queſtions, which the particular Law has not touch'd upon; if there be not ſome other Law to flie to, there muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue either a failer of juſtice as to thoſe caſes, which would draw on a ſelf-revenge; or elſe the ſetling them muſt be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and at will, which a people will not long endure.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, there is no Nation in the World, that abounds with all things. There is no people ſo well fortified, but that they may ſtand in need of the aſsiſtance of others, either in matter of commerce, or to joyn in oppoſing a common enemy, who watches to deſtroy them both. When as therefore the implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this forreign help, or the tranſportation of our native commodities to thoſe that can ſupply us with theirs, which we have not, drives us to a neceſsity of dealing with other people; it is ſubſtantially needfull alſo to order ſuch dealings by, to have ſome Law or rules generally known, and unqueſtionably juſt to both.</p>
                     <p>There being therefore a neceſsity of another Law, beſides the particular Law of each Countrey, the Civil Law has been choſen by moſt forreign States, becauſe it has from the time of the Romans run through all Nations, and has been ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally applauded and allowed of by all, that now at laſt it has purchaſed to it ſelf the honour to be ſtyled, <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> the Law of Nations, or <hi>jus commune,</hi> the common Law of all <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe it hath more in it of the Law of Nature, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all mankind, then any other Law of Man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Civil Law is of ſuch large extent, and ſo vaſt a comprehenſion, that nothing can fall out, wherein the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Law, equity, or any part of juſtice may be neceſſary, which either the words of that Law, or the reaſon thereof will not decide: For indeed the Romans, through the Univerſal power they had over a great part of the World, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing ſeveral wayes with the reſt, were brought acquainted with the nature and ſtate of all Humane affairs of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it provides not for the welfare and intereſt of one Nation onely, as a particular Law does, but contemplates and takes care for the general affairs of all people: For it treats of all manner of differences ariſing between one State and another,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100164:88"/>of the Laws of war and articles of peace, of leagues, truces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals, rights and priviledges of Embaſſadours, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of priſoners; of precedencies due to Princes; of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of trade to forreigners, and of the reſtraint thereof upon juſt and weighty reaſons; of the free and common uſe of the Sea, and how it may be interdicted or limited; of all contracts in and about ſhipping or tranſportation; of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages or injuries done at Sea; of Cuſtomes, Wrecks, Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Salvage, or contribution; of aſſurances made upon ſhips or goods; of the carrying of Armes, Money, or Men, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or ſtrengthen our enemies; of the conditions given for the ſurrendring beſieged places, by whom they may be effectually made, and how far they may be extended; whether change of governour and government can diſſolve amity, friendſhip and reſpect between us and other States. Theſe and ſuch like are matters of concernment to other States as well as to our ſelves, and are not medled with by Municipal Laws, but fall under the learning of the Civil Law onely; whereby it muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a moſt noble and uſefull ſcience, the profit thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not confin'd to one Territory, but communicable to the whole ſociety of Men.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the precepts and rules of this Law are but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of natural reaſon, and which command the aſſent and approbation of the moſt judicious, when firſt propounded. And ſo ſatisfactory and convincing is the juſtice thereof both to ſubjects and ſtrangers of other Nations, that it ſilenceth the complaints of thoſe, who are thereby condemned, their own reaſon and conſciouſneſs concurring in that condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, it is the uſe of the Civil Law that holds up the entercourſe and correſpondence of nations each with other; for where the rules of judging controverſies, as oft as they do ariſe, are certainly known and allowed of, there any Prince or people will be ſtrongly invited to Trade, make Leagues, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry, ſend their Embaſſadours, and communicate all other offices of love and friendſhip whatſoever: becauſe they know what dealing they ſhall have from them, and what juſtice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at their hands. But where <hi>illud juſtum eſt quod eſt utile,</hi> that is, where advantage does rather ſet the rule for juſtice then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100164:88"/>right reaſon; or where it muſt be adminiſtred by preſcriptions of their own deviſing, which none can diſcern any equity or reaſon in, nor underſtand but themſelves, ſuch a Nation muſt make much of themſelves, and be contented to ſubſiſt of what they have of their own; for no other Prince or people will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to deal or correſpond with them.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, thoſe that are the compoſers of this Law, in the ordaining thereof had not, as is uſuall in the making of other Laws, the advantages of State in their eye, nor the honour and greatneſs of thoſe that had the government, nor any meerly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick conſiderations whatſoever; much leſſe did they look at the particular benefit of any private men. But as in publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>ſalus populi</hi> was <hi>ſuprema lex,</hi> ſo in private, <hi>quod aequum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num<expan>
                              <am>

                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> fuit,</hi> was that which made up the Law with them; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of true right and pure equity was thought the moſt effectuall means to preſerve the whole. And hence it is, that the ſincere equity of the Roman Civil Law has been owned, and the wiſdome of it greatly admired by thoſe, to whom the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the Roman State, and the intereſt of the Rulers of it could not be known.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, this Law is ſo well tempered, and ſo indifferently compoſed, that it may be accommodated to any kind or form of government; ſo that be the Supreme power in one, or be it in few, or be it in the whole people, it is equally uſeful for them all: for <hi>Rome</hi> came under all theſe ſeverall formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſome part of the Civil Law was made under each of them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Triall, that is the true Touchſtone of Laws as of all things elſe whatſoever, has exalted it above all other Laws of Man. Firſt, in the general uſe of it every where about the World. Secondly, in the continuance of it to this preſent time, after the State and Government of <hi>Rome</hi> has long ago ceaſed to be, and againſt all ſtormes and tempeſts that have come. Thirdly, in that all States and Common-wealths have exceedingly flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that have made uſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>And yet we are not ſuch vain exalters of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as to think, or boaſt, that the Civil Law has the force or property of a Law within it, ſo as to preſcribe to or bind forreign Nations.<note n="h" place="margin">Leges non alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur in curiis Principum aut regum pro au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate, ſed prorationc ſui.

We ſay this further, that though in matters of publick government the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ears ſway, and is practiſed altogether in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for thoſe muſt be managed by ſuch prudent wayes and means, as the ſupreme Governours from time to time ſhall think moſt neceſſary; without being tied up to any certain rules even of their own, much leſs to any of the Roman Empire: yet in private controverſial things, ariſing between man and man, ſome ſpecial matters of more publick and general concernment excepted, the Civil Law is much more practiſed and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed, then the Municipal. Becauſe in reſpect of the great variety and multitude of ſuch caſes, the Municipal Law can declare but little that is certain in them: So that though we cannot ſay, that forreign States are governed by the Civil Law, yet the ſuits and differences their ſubjects have one with another, are for the moſt part judg'd and ended by it. But the admittance of the Civil Law in theſe caſes, how general ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, is voluntary and free, without either neceſſity or conſtraint.</p>
                     <p>And we do ſo little think, that the want of a compulſive and binding power does in any part obſcure the luſtre of it, as in our judgments that very conſideration does commend it much more, and makes the merit of it much more conſpicuous and ſplendid; for to be awed by an impoſed Law, argues the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the power that impoſes it, and the ſervility and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people that are under it, but no worth and excellency in the Law it ſelfe: for peradventure if they were left to their full freedome, they would chuſe to live under ſome more natural and more reaſonable Law. But when a Prince and people ſhall of their own accord without direction or command from any other, freely embrace a Law, and deſire to be tried and judg'd thereby (as forreign States do by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law) it is an evident token, that this free aſſuming of ſuch a Law, proceeds from ſome known ſingular vertue and rare good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in it; for elſe they would not, being at liberty, be ſo unanimouſly guided and directed by the ſame.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The admittance and ſway of the Civil Law in forreign parts, is yet further verified by the teſtimonies of Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> and Dr <hi>Hakewill,</hi> the one a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the other a famous learned Divine of our own, and by ſome other remarkable institutions within this Nation.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have before told you, what a great and renowned King of this Nation, and five great Sages of the National Law have ſaid concerning the fame and practiſe of the Civil Law in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations. I connot paſs by what Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> a moſt famous Scholar and Stateſ-man of this Nation, and one who in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time went Embaſſadour to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo had the opportunity to know more of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thoſe that ſit at home, has written <hi>obiter</hi> to the very ſame purpoſe, in his book <hi>De Republica Anglorum.</hi> Wherein after he has delineated and ſet forth the true ſtate of the policy and forme of government within this Common-wealth, and wherein the Laws thereof do greatly differ from that, which other States do obſerve and follow, in his third book, ca. 11. he cloſes in this manner. <hi>Adminiſtrationis &amp; Politiae Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae formam quaſi in tabula breviter vobis ad intuendum propoſui; Quid ſuum habeat, quiàque ab aliis rebuſpublicis, Gallorum, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, Hispanorum, Germanorum, diverſum, quae civilibus legibus Romanorum in Pandectas &amp; Codicem à Juſtiniano redactis reguntur, enarravi.</hi> The form of Policy and government of <hi>England,</hi> ſaith he, I have as it were in a Map briefly ſet down before you to be ſeen, what it has proper to it ſelf, and what differing from other Common-wealths, to wit, of <hi>France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Spain, Germany,</hi> which, ſaith he, are ſwayed by thoſe Civil Laws of the Romans, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> did put into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts and the Code, I have likewiſe ſhewed you.</p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100164:90"/>
                     <p>The teſtimony alſo of Dr <hi>Hakewill,</hi> a great Divine of this Countrey alſo, is as full to the ſame matter; for in his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Apologie of the power and providence of God,<note n="i" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>7.</hi> ſect. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> he does not onely rank the Civil Law next to the Law of God, but alſo avows the profeſſours thereof in ſome forreign parts to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally better ſcholars then their Divines; and the Lawyers of this laſt age to be much more able in their learning and skill, then the Lawyers of former ages have been. Of the which he will have the reaſon to be, the great ſway, intereſt and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they have had in the Judicial Courts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that has given them ſuch encouragement. Next Gods Laws, ſaith he, thoſe of the Empire ſeem to challenge their place; howbeit with us, having neither that reward nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as they deſerve, they have loſt both their rank and dignity: but in forreign parts, where they are cheriſhed and honoured, they marvellouſly flouriſh; inſomuch as in ſome tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Kingdomes their Lawyers are held, and for the moſt part are undoubtedly more ſufficient Scholars they their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; and within this laſt Centenary, much more ſufficient then the writers and profeſſours of the ſame faculty in many precedent ages, as well in that part which is profeſſed in Schools, as the practick expreſſed in judgments and pleadings. Now for the latter part, which is the practick, ſaith he, it may eaſily be evidenced to any who will be pleaſed to look into it, that by the obſervations, experience, paines, and learning of the Lawyers of thoſe latter ages, it is grown to much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and perfection then former ages had. Which appears by the judgments, deciſions, arreſts, and pleadings of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Courts of the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Nations, which are extant in great numbers; as the Deciſions of the ſeveral Rotes of <hi>Italy,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> at <hi>Genoa,</hi> at <hi>Bononia,</hi> at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Peruſium,</hi> and the reſt: the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Imperial Chamber at <hi>Spire,</hi> which is the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of the German Nation; and the arreſts of the ſeveral Courts of Parliament in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Paris, Aiz, Burdeaux, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi> and the reſt. To which may be added the pleadings of Monſieur <hi>Servine,</hi> the French Kings Advocate, and others of that nature, which are all publiſhed and extant, partly in Latin,

                     <p>But to paſs from what is obſerved by our own Countrey-men in this particular, is not there an ancient inſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> that does clearly demonſtrate the ſame thing? for if we were not ſure that the Civil Law did paſs for currant, and were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally embraced in forreign parts, why ſhould we alwayes to this very day obſerve to try and decide all differences, that ariſe between our own Countrey-men and Strangers either upon or beyond the Sea, in the Court of Admiralty; where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are onely after the forme of the Civil Law? And were it not to pleaſe forreigners in the Law they like and allow of, we might when we had them here, ſtrictly hold them to our own Laws. But ſince we muſt trade and traffick with them, it were no indifferency to call them from the trial of that Law which they in ſome part know, and is the Law of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as themſelves make it, to the trial of a Law which they know in no part, and is meer forreign unto them.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe, if the Treaties that we have had with forreign Princes were ſurveyed, it would be found, that they run in the language, and are tranſacted by the skill and knowledge of the ſame Law. It is evident therefore, that it is uſed and accepted of every where upon and beyond the ſeas; ſince that where we deal with ſtrangers moſt, and have moſt variance with them, there it is moſt uſed even amongſt our ſelves:</p>
                     <p>And to the ſame ground and reaſon does Mr <hi>Selden</hi> in his diſcourſe upon <hi>Fleta</hi>

                        </note> impute it, that the practiſe of the Civil Law has been continued alwayes in the Marſhals Court here in <hi>England,</hi> where divers cauſes might ariſe, that might concern ſtrangers; as alſo in the Judiciall Courts in both Univerſities, where ſtrangers for ſtudy ſake do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently come to ſettle: though for my part I cannot think, that the Univerſities uſe it for any other reaſon, then for the pure natural equity and ſound reaſon that is in it above all the Laws in the World beſides; nor for any other end, then that young men trained up and made expert in that profeſſion, when they come abroad, might be more ready in all matters of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation and commerce, that the Prince or State ſhould in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100164:91"/>their dealing with forreign Nations have occaſion to uſe them in, when ever they were call'd to any ſuch imployment; to which the Laws of this Land ſerve nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>It is needleſs in ſo clear a matter to offer any further proof to convince our Countrey-men, that all their neighbours beyond the Seas (that are nevertheleſs wiſe, rich, and potent) do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be judg'd and directed by the Civil Law and the profeſſours of it. I ſhall therefore as touching this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular add but two things, which in my judgment are very well worth the obſervation.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Code (which is a collection of the Emperours Laws onely, from the dayes of <hi>Adrian</hi> unto the age of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf) is in uſe even amongſt the Turkes.<note n="l" place="margin">Stephan.

                     <p>The ſecond is, that even in the territory of the Church, where the patrimony and the juriſdiction of the Popes lieth, this Law has in ſome caſes an intereſt of guidance in the Tribunals there too. And yet if the precious worth that is in it, did not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate them, there are not forcible and weighty reaſons want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make them abhor and decline the ſame: For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſome of the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, as <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Theodoſius, Martian,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> did ordaine divers Laws for the ordering of Church-matters and Church-men; which ſince the Popes look'd upon as an uſurpation, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon their ſpiritual juriſdiction, Temporal Princes being the diſpoſers of temporal things onely, as they ſuppoſe, and not to meddle with ſpiritual; it might well beget in them an animoſity and diſlike againſt the Law it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Church has a large Law of their own, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law; and ſo large, that it may be thought ſufficient to ſet a rule to all that Churches affairs whatſoever, and need not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row help from any other Laws.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, there has alwayes been as it were an emulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which of theſe two Laws ſhould be the moſt potent, and ſpread furtheſt in the Chriſtian World.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Popes in theſe latter ages have not ſtuck to make open proteſtation, that the Pontificial dignity was rather to give Laws to the Emperours, then receive any from them.</p>
                     <p>And are not theſe, if there were no other, grounds enough to make them tender how they admitted the Civil Law into their Territories? yet ſuch has been the power and force of that Law, that it has got footing even in that Spiritual Monarchy; for where ſin againſt God comes not to be reſtrained, or puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor the ſoul and conſcience diſciplined in order to its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual welfare (which was the main end of ordaining the Canon Law) but that the caſe is meerly temporal and worldly, and not decided by the Canon Law, there the Civil Law gives the rule even in the Popes dominions; <hi>non viſua,</hi> ſayes <hi>Suarez,</hi>

                     <p>And indeed ſetting aſide ſome few ſpecial differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Civil Law and the Canon as to ſome particulars, the Canon Law is nothing elſe but the Civil Law applied to the uſe of the Church and Church matters.

                     <p>This is not ſo truly averred of the Canon Law, but the ſame may be as juſtly affirmed of the particular Law of every Nation that is any thing famous either for Laws or Government. For undoubtedly, the beſt governed Nations have wrote their Laws by the copy of the Roman, and the Civil Law has been the Womb that has born and brought forth all of them; neither can they judiciouſly clear the obſcure meaning &amp; doubtful ſenſe of their own Laws, without they make uſe of the learning of the Civil Law, from whence they ſprang originally, for a help to interpret them. And therefore which of them ſoever does caſt out of their Territories the Civil Law, they do plainly put out the light of their own Laws, and do abandon and exile that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which their own Laws, for ſo much as is good in them, are but the off-ſpring; ſince by the teſtimony of <hi>Claudian</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AMongſt other notes and characters of Honour, that Nations have beſtowed upon the Roman Law, this is not the leaſt; That it bears to this very day that name and ſtyle, which not only diſtinguiſhes it from the Laws of other Nations, but in a way of eminency extols and ſets it above them all: for although from that which every City, Countrey, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does obſerve for their binding Law, is derived that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar appellation of the Civil Law of that particular place; as the Municipal Law of <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> may be called The Civil Law of <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain:</hi> yet he that is to mention
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100164:92"/>the Municipal Law of any one Countrey or Nation, beſides the Roman, if he would expreſs it by the name of the Civil Law, he will not be underſtood, except he adds the proper name of that Countrey too, whereof he intends to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>But the common uſe of ſpeaking ſtill to this very day obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the beſt and greateſt Nations, is clean otherwiſe, as oft as mention is to be made of the Law of the Roman State; for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it you may call it, <hi>The Civil Law of the Romans,</hi> yet does it paſs currently under the ſimple denomination of <hi>The Civil Law;</hi> and you are intended to ſpeak of that peculiar Law, though you do not ſubjoyn the proper name of that ſtate or people. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Roman Emperour did firſt enact it as a Law and as a binding direction to the Roman people; <hi>Quoties non addimus nomen, cujus ſit civitatis, noſtrum juſ ſignificamus;</hi>

                     <p>And it is a ſure token of a ſuperlative excellency, when a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral appellation that is common to all things of the ſame rank and quality, is ſpecially and by common conſent beſtowed upon one peculiar thing of the ſame kind. What was the reaſon that <hi>Rome</hi> was call'd, <hi>The City,</hi> when there was ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Cities beſides it, but becauſe none came near it in power, greatneſs, riches, or magnificence? Or that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when there were ſo many known Philoſophers beſides, ſhould be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally named, <hi>The Philoſopher,</hi> but becauſe the reſt knew not the true eſſence of things ſo well as he, nor had dived ſo deeply into the ſecrets of nature as he had done? Or that <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhould be ſtyled the Poet amongſt the Latines, and <hi>Homer</hi> amongſt the Greeks, amidſt ſo many other Poets contemporary with and a great many others ſince ſucceeding them, but becauſe they two far exceeded them all? Or that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould be termed, <hi>The Wiſe man,</hi> and St <hi>Paul, The Apoſtle,</hi> when certainly wiſdome was to be found in others, and in a great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, as well as in <hi>Solomon;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was but one of twelve Apoſtles, but becauſe the Wiſdome of <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſurpaſs the wiſdome of all men under the Sun, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:100164:93"/>was thought to be more inſpired, and to have greater gifts and endowments given him, then other Apoſtles had? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and upon the ſame ground is it, that although every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is brought under rule and government, and is not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, has a certain peculiar Civil Law, under which it lives and is governed; yet out of a general belief, that no other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law whatſoever is to be compared with the Roman Law, does it ſtill, as anciently it did, carry away the name and title of, <hi>The Civil Law,</hi> from them all, as being the exacteſt and perfecteſt of all other Laws in the World beſides.</p>

                        <hi>eſt rerum divinarum atque bumanarum notitia, juſti atque injuſti ſcientia;</hi> The ſcience of the Law teaches what is the right both in Holy and Worldly things, and what is juſt and unjuſt; both ſpeaking of the Roman Law: ſo was it accounted then, and no otherwiſe is it accounted now too. For,</p>
                     <p>Whereas the learned of the world do reckon upon three ſupreme Arts and Sciences, Divinity, Law, and Phyſick, which do ſo mainly ſupport and hold up the whole frame of Man, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100164:93"/>without them this goodly linke of things here below muſt needs diſſolve and fall away to nothing; by the Art of Law, it is far from their meaning to comprehend the Municipal Law of any Nation, which is fitted for the climate of one people onely, and ſerves for the exigencies and occaſions of the State, and varies as times and occaſions, and the diſpoſitions of the men do vary; which commands rather then teaches; which has an eye more to what is profitable to the publick, then what is juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and which deals more in the great advantages of State, then in ſetling private intereſts, or compoſing differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man: (for this is the true ſtate of the locall conſtitutions of the ſeveral and reſpective Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the World; each of them being far ſhort of deciding thoſe many doubts and queſtions, that muſt needs happen in great variety between their ſubjects, whileſt they trade and deal together.) But they underſtand ſome more Univerſal Law, that is commonly embraced and allowed of by the beſt and moſt potent Nations; that is full of pure equity and true reaſon, and being grounded upon dictates of nature and common reaſon, is unchangeable; whoſe method is to teach and inſtruct by certain rules and principles orderly and handſomly digeſted, as well as to command and order; and which amongſt the frequent and various dealings of men, does leave few caſes that can happen undecided.</p>
                     <p>And it is evident, that by this Art of Law, they intend no other but the Roman Civil Law: for although the Laws have been a making almoſt ever ſince <hi>Rome</hi> was firſt built, and were ordained as queſtions did ariſe from time to time, and under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral forms of government; <hi>Rome</hi> being ſometimes under the rule of one, ſometimes of more, and ſometimes of the whole people; and grew at laſt to an infinite multitude, and lay in a confuſed and indigeſted heap, void of all order or method: Yet at laſt <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> when he came to the Empire, did ſet upon that <hi>opus desperatum,</hi> as he calls it in his <hi>Prooeme</hi> to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, that deſperate enterprize of diſpoſing them into that admirable order that now we ſee them in; and indeed was the firſt that laid the foundation for the building up of the Art and Science of Laws.</p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:100164:94"/>
                     <p>By his means it was, that after the beſt and moſt uſefull Laws were ſelected and choſen out of a vaſt and tumultuous heap, they were diſtributed into Titles, and the Titles into Books, every Title contains thoſe Laws that are proper and pertinent to that principal ſubject whereof that Title treateth; ſometimes by definition opening the true ſtate and nature of it; ſometimes if it be various, dividing it into its ſeveral kinds and branches: alſo ſubjoyning a reſolution of the ſeveral caſes and queſtions that come under it, rather by the ſtill voice of right reaſon, and as all men by their natural inſtinct, and practical experience would agree to determine them, then by ſovereign command or imperial will.</p>
                     <p>After this method is that principal part of the Law the Digeſts, otherwiſe called the Pandects compoſed; which <hi>Duarenus</hi> cals the Magazine and Store-houſe of all equity, juſtice, and learning, and the artificial framing thereof <hi>Cuiacius</hi>

                     <p>But to make this ſcience of the Law yet perfecter, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> hath alſo added his book of Inſtitutions, for no other end, but, as himſelf teſtifies, <hi>ut ſint totius legitimae ſcientiae prima elementa,</hi> the introduction to the whole Law, they being indeed the ſumme and ſubſtance of it: and he directs it, <hi>cupidae legum juventuti,</hi> to thoſe that ſhall deſire to enter upon that ſtudy; intending it as a help to the younger ſtudents onely, whereby they might be enabled after the reading thereof, the better to undertake the more difficult and voluminous books of the Law: for he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that the other volumes of the Law would prove too hard and tedious for young beginners, and ſo it might come to paſs, that the whole ſtudy of the Law might be quite laid aſide, and utterly periſh for want of ſome to ſtudy the ſame, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this little book of Inſtitutions to be made, whereby young men might be invited partly with the briefneſs, and partly with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100164:94"/>the eaſineſs thereof, to the ſtudy and profeſſion of it. Here then is a great body of Law orderly and methodically diſpoſed, and a book of praeliminary Inſtitutions alſo, to make the entrance into it eaſier and more beneficial.</p>
                     <p>But there are two Volumes more of this Law alſo, the one collected by <hi>Justinian</hi> as the Digeſts were, and that's the Code; the other ordained by him, as the Inſtitutions were, and that's the Authenticks, otherwiſe called the Novell Conſtitutions: for the firſt is but a bare collection of ſuch deciſions, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours that had ſate in the Roman Empire even to <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time had made to the queſtions that had been propounded to them, ſometimes by Judges, and ſometimes by private perſons, as in contingency they fell; and are ranked in the ſame order and method as the Digeſts are. In the Authenticks there is not that order obſerved in the diſpoſition of Laws as is either in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, or the Code, but as occaſion was offered of any doubt, wherein the Princes reſolution was neceſſary to every thing, ſo it is ſet down without any other method or form. And they were call'd the Novels, becauſe they were new Laws, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Laws of the Digeſts, Inſtitutions, or the Code; and ſometimes they alter and correct the Laws of the other three.</p>
                     <p>Thus far went <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf in his deſign of a general ſurvey and diſpoſure of the Roman Laws; ſometimes ordaining Laws of his own, and ſometimes gathering together the Laws of others, till he had made an exact and abſolute compoſition. Which enterpriſe that renowned ſcholar and Stateſman of our Countrey Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> does ſo much commend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, in his Epiſtle to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſet before his book of Maxims of Law, that when he underſtood, that ſhe had the like purpoſe in her breaſt, to enter into a general amendment of the ſtate of her Laws, and to reduce them to more brevity and certainty; he ſaith, it ſtruck him with great admiration, when he heard it; and acknowledges it to be one of the moſt choſen works, and of higheſt merit and beneficence towards the ſubject, that ever entred into the mind of any King; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that there be rare preſidents of it in government, as it cometh to paſs in things ſo excellent, there being no preſident
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100164:95"/>full in view but that of <hi>Justinian,</hi> as he confeſſeth. Whoſe work is the more to be admired, becauſe the uſe thereof is not local, nor reſtrained to the ſtate and policy of one Nation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as hers would have been, but may ſerve for the uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of any ſtate or people whatſoever, and is ſubſervient to all accidents and occaſions that can happen in common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and inded has for its object ſuch things, as commonly ariſe every where throughout the World, and have no Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal or cuſtomary Law to determine them.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſhould be thought to have failed in any thing of bringing this Art to a full perfection, yet what the learned of Chriſtendome from his time downward to this preſent, has done towards the perfecting thereof, will make it up: for the infinite number of writers of all ſorts, of all Nations, and in all ages, that have wrote hereupon, are prodigious to behold, and wonderful to conſider.</p>
                     <p>What Gloſſes, Notes, Lectures, Repetitions, Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Paratitles, Analyſes, Intellects, are there upon the very Laws themſelves? There is hardly any Text of Law that is not copiouſly written on, either in ſtating the true reading of it, or in clearing it from obſcurity, or in enlarging upon the matter of it. Then as to the general ſubjects of the Law, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes and queſtions that fall under them, both ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and practicall, the Tractats, Diſcourſes, Counſels, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, Reports, common Opinions, Controverſies, Reſolutions, Practices, Obſervations, and Singulars, are without number.</p>
                     <p>Even this latter age of ours, beſides all that which foregoing antiquity has produced, has brought forth every where in all Countreys of renown ſo many famous writers in this kind, that every Nation has ſeemed to be at an emulous contention each with other, which ſhould moſt excel in ſuch men.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>France,</hi> are reckoned <hi>Cuiacius, Briſſonius, Molinaeus, Antonie Faber, Peter Faber, Rebuffus, Bodinus, Tholoſanus, Gothofred, Choppinus, Bellonus, Papo, Charondas, Hottoman,</hi> all of high account in that faculty.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Spain,</hi> there are famous to this day, <hi>Covarruvias, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mezius, Vaſquius, Alvarez, Gregorie Lopez, Bernardus Diaz, Villagut, Pinellus, Franciſcus Salgado de Somoza, Sarmientus, Rodericus Suarez, Johannes Lupus.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Every one of theſe has left ſuch writings behind him in the Civil Law, as will makes their memories immortal. Neither can it be any wonder, that the Civil Law it ſelf, and the books thereof are grown ſo voluminous and almoſt infinite. Becauſe indeed that Science does comprehend that vaſt and great variety of affairs and worldly buſineſs, that the large Nation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans dealt in during the long continuance of that great and large Empire. And ſince have been added unto it, and ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it were by the rule thereof, and applied unto it, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of many Nations, which muſt in all changes and accidents, and in each Nation be many, various, and ſeveral from the time of the Empire down to this preſent. Which being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally writ upon, by ſeveral fancies, and in ſeveral wayes and methods, muſt needs produce throughout the World large and copious writings in this faculty, as it has in all other Arts and Sciences beſides. But the benefit that the world reaps thereby, lies in this, that there neither is or can be any contract made, or any human affair tranſacted, either Domeſtick, Civil, or Military, either between governours and governed, or between the people themſelves one with another, or between Nation and Nation, either upon ſea or upon land, but by the help of that ſtudy and the writings thereof, there may be found moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rules and directions; ſometimes to diſcern the true nature of the thing it ſelf; ſometimes to diſcern its kinds; ſometimes to reſolve the doubts and queſtions that fall under it; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to juſtifie it as wholly good and lawful; and ſometimes to condemn it as altogether unjuſt and evil. And if the action be not uniform, but various, and may be in ſome caſes good and in others evil, it will diſtinguiſh upon the ſeveral caſes; that dealers may walk ſecurely and ſafely, if they will guide their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100164:96"/>actions by the preſcript of that Law, where the Laws and cuſtomes of their own Countrey doe not direct them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>No part of this pains has been taken or honour done by the learned of forreign States to the Municipal Law of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides the Roman; for although every State may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully affect and be delighted with their own Laws, and ſo it may come to paſs, that they may be greatly extoll'd and ſet up, and ſometimes with much induſtry and great benefit to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects interpreted, explained, and writ upon by the writings of their own Countrey-men; yet are they of ſo little eſteem and account with forreigners, that they almoſt diſdain to read them. But where any have imployed their pens in writing upon a Law of another Nation, no one example can be given, but in the Civil Law onely; which has buſied and ſet on work the learned of the whole World.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, what high applauſe ſoever may be given to the local conſtitutions of any people (as queſtionleſs they are all uſeful within their proper territories) yet it is a truth unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, that in the account of other Nations, whatſoever the caſe or queſtion be; be it between their own ſubjects, ſo that their own National Laws and cuſtomes do not ſpecially order it; or be it between them and other Princes, or their ſubjects, the Civil Law is the ſtraiteſt rule and the beſt guide to decide it by; and the art and skill to diſpenſe equal right and exact juſtice to all men, is to be learnt from the ſtudy of no other Law of mans creation but that Law onely. <hi>Nihil aliud eſt jus Civile, quàm ſententiae quaedam à veteribus Juriſconſultis pronunciatae, quae in certum redactae ordinem, dijudicandi rationem noſtris Juriſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis oſtendunt,</hi> ſays <hi>Machiavell</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Prooem</hi> to his books <hi>de republica</hi> The Civil Law is nothing more then certain dictates or principles declared by the ancient lawyers (undoubtedly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Papinian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, Scaevola, Africanus, Pomponius, Neratins, Celſus, Marcianus,</hi> and the reſt, whoſe names are prefixed before their ſeveral Laws in the Digeſt) which being put into good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, do inſtruct others in the wayes of adminiſtring right and juſtice. And hence is it, that in all the Univerſities through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, I will not except <hi>England,</hi> the Law that is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100164:96"/>the Law that is publickly read and taught in their Schools, the Law wherein degrees are taken, is the Civil Laws.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>An Anſwer to the main Objections that are now adayes made againſt the continuance of the Civil Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Nation.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THeſe things that have been thus truly delivered to the praiſe and commendation of the Civil Law, being clear and evident, our Adverſaries the Anticivilians will not ſo vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend, as to oppoſe them, or to detract from the worth of that learning, which has been ſo generally owned by all the World, nor was ever brought into any queſtion, ſince it was firſt propagated and made known to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſides the Roman. They will, as they muſt, admit and acknowledge, that the Civil Law doth more abound with natural reaſon and equity, then any other Law of mans eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing; that it has ſpread further into the World, then any Law ever did; and has been more ſtudied and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the writings of the learned of all Nations and langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then any Law that yet has been; that the profeſſion thereof is of ſo large a compaſs, that it takes in and treats of all the affairs, contracts, and dealings of the World; that Princes freely entertain it into their Judicatories, and miniſter right and juſtice onely by the learned and Graduates of that profeſſion; that the principles of ſolid wiſdome and beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Honeſty are taught thereby; that it has deſcribed and ſet down the duties of all people of what relation ſoever, more amply, and more to the pattern of nature and right reaſon then any other Law has done. Yet this free and ample acknowledgment notwithſtanding, they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the uſe and practiſe thereof in the miniſtration of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100164:97"/>juſtice within this nation to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient or neceſſary, ſuggeſting to themſelves certain reaſons ſtrong and important, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, why that profeſſion how learned and wiſe ſoever in it ſelf, yet ſince it is become uſeleſs, as to the people of this Nation, it cannot conveniently, as our affairs are now changed, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued here any longer, as they imagine. Which opinion how well it is grounded, it is meet and requiſite we ſhould in the next place examine; for except it may be maintained that it is alſo uſefull and very neceſſary for the Common-wealth under which we now live, and no way, or at leaſt, in compariſon of the great benefits thereof, not conſiderably inconvenient, all the other excellencies and rare qualities that can be ſpoken thereof, will turn but into a ſpeculative and ayrie diſcourſe, and will move nothing towards the begetting of a publick ſettlement thereof within the Nation: for, they will ſay, all rules and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that are uſeful to inform the underſtanding, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion the manners and actions of private men or of Princes, as they are men onely, may not preſently be fitting or neceſſary to regulate and direct a State in the carrying on of publick buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Let it therefore be added for a further commendation of the Imperial Law; firſt, that as it containes the dictates of nature, the concluſions of right reaſon, and as it ſets forth the natural and eſſential properties of ſuch humane things, contracts and dealings of men, whereof it treats, (of all which without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon the greateſt plenty lies recorded in the writings of the Civil Law) I ſay, as it containes all theſe, it is ſo eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the well ordering of all States and the common affairs of men, that it cannot be aboliſhed through any change of Law or government whatſoever, but at the ſame inſtant the peace and well-being of that State and people muſt needs vaniſh and diſſolve alſo: For can the Sun fall from the firmament, and the world not be at an end? or the ſoule expire, and the body not be void of life or motion? No more can the ſplendour of that people endure any longer, where the ſun of natural equity and juſtice has left to ſhine amongſt them; nor can the body of a Common-wealth grow proſperous or flouriſhing, that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the ſoundneſs of right reaſon, which is the very ſoul
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100164:97"/>and ſpirit of all Law and government: for in this it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with a whole ſociety of men, then it is with one individual perſon.</p>
                     <p>If a man ſhall be unnatural, and cares not to obſerve true right and juſt reaſon in his dealings with other men, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renders himſelf odious and deteſtable to all men, and it is lookt upon as dangerous to have any dealings or to be familiar with ſuch a perſon. So if a State, which is a collective body of men, when they are appealed to for common right, either by their own people, or by other Nations, ſhall adminiſter that for right, which croſſes natural juſtice, and the notions of right reaſon, it expoſes it ſelf to ſcorn and obloquie, it gaules and exaſperates their own ſubjects, and makes their neighbours ſtand at a diſtance with them: and the condition of that State muſt needs be dangerous and unſure, having loſt their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both at home and abroad. Onely here is the difference, and it is a ſad one; The danger of particular injuſtice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in ſome detriment of a few; but national injuſtice drawes after it ofttimes the ruine and confuſion of many Nations.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the impreſſions of nature and reaſon are ſo ſtrong in man and ſo great a part of his eſſence, that they cannot be quite expunged or deleted in him; neither can they be ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, but they will at length have their return —<hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram expellas furcalicet, uſque recurret</hi>— and inclinations and affections thereunto will appear, even when the contrary is performed. So true is that of the Civil Law, <hi>Jura naturalia ſunt immutabilia;</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Parag. <hi>11.</hi> Inſt. De jur. nat. geut. &amp; Civil.</note> The Laws of nature and the common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of nations are unchangeable, and are not capable to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
                     <p>For if it were once admitted, that theſe Laws were alterable, what ſtrange contradictions and ſenſleſs incongruities would follow? And how would man be raviſhed as it were from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his reaſon one chief part of his eſſence being taken away? Beſides, how would ſins and treſpaſſes againſt nature multiply? How common would natural injuſtice be? and what loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints thereof would ariſe? whereby not onely great confuſion would break in, and the peace of the Common-wealth be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100164:98"/>but the common ſociety of Nations would in time alſo ceaſe. The Civil Law then, as it is natural, eſſential, or rational, cannot be repealed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let it be ſpoken to its praiſe alſo, that the Civil Law is ſo far from being made uſeleſs to a Nation, where the whole ſtate of Government has been ſubverted, as that it is thereby become more uſeful and neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that the Roman people themſelves thought it ſo, when they diſpatcht certain choſen men on purpoſe to fetch it from <hi>Athens</hi> for their uſe and ſervice, after they had driven out their Kings, ſuppreſſed their Laws, and erected a popular government in place of the Regal. The like opinion poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth now adayes the Princes and potentates of the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> as is clearly demonſtrated by their admitting the learning and profeſſion thereof into their ſeveral Territories, that it may be at hand to decide and reſolve ſuch caſes and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of right, that happen amongſt their people, wherein a Law of their own is wanting:</p>
                     <p>Nay, if any ſuch difference or controverſie ariſes between the Princes themſelves, or between Nation and Nation, which is moſt frequent and common; becauſe there never was nor can be by any authority a poſitive Law made to bind them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and argue ſuch differences by arguments fetcht from the Civil Law, and allow of the reaſon thereof as a moſt competent and equal rule to decide them by.</p>
                     <p>And if this ſupply of juſtice by the learning and knowledge of the Civil Law were taken away too, what ignorance, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, arbitrarineſs, injuſtice, and oppreſſion would the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world lie under? and what hazards of detriment or ruine would their rights, fortunes, and eſtates be expoſed unto? for where all manner of Law is wanting in a Common-weale, to do the acts of juſtice and miniſtration of right by, it muſt be granted, that the light of natural reaſon muſt of neceſſity be the Law; ſince that was the onely means which was given to man at firſt to judge and diſcern by of humane things, before any Law was given. But if that ſhould depend upon the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring fancies and imaginations of men onely, and not be illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by ſome right knowledge and learning, under how many
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100164:98"/>ſeveral ſhapes and forms muſt it needs appear, when the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and conceptions of men through the variety of natural gifts, education, age, knowledge, and experience, are as diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By the converſion and change of State therefore, though the Municipal Law goes to wrack (as commonly ſuch great frames are ſeldome medled withal, but all falls a pieces) the Civil Law is not the leſs, but rather the more neceſſary to be retained ſtill; Firſt, becauſe it hath no coherence or conglutination with the particular cuſtomes or government, either Regal or Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, as the Municipal Law hath, and ſo the one may fall, and yet the other ſtand. Secondly, becauſe the Civil Law is the proper Art and Science of that right natural reaſon, which for want of other rules in the doing of juſtice, we have ſaid muſt neceſſarily be the common ſtandard to try all things by. The principles of which Art and Science are not weak or ſuperficial, but ſtrong and ſolid; not various or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but certain and agreeing; not harſh and rigorous, but tender, compaſſionate, and equitable; not partial to any, but alike juſt to all; not obſcure and perplexed, but clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the eyes of judicious and right diſcerning men, though above the reach of the vulgar. Thirdly, becauſe it carries the weight of undeniable authority along with it, the deciſions thereof being not the ſudden fancies and raw conceits
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100164:99"/>of a few men, nor do they reſt upon the bare Reports of any, how learned in the Law ſoever, but they are the clear evidence of Reaſon, and the prudent adviſements and mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a whole State, excelling in wiſdome, mighty in greatneſs, and famous in renown.</p>
                     <p>And howſoever it was at firſt ordained to be a Law for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nation to be ruled by, yet has it ſince been made univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in uſe throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> and by the general conſent of all the learned ſprung up to an Art or Science, to teach natural juſtice and equity to all mankind. Fourthly, becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Civil Law does not onely rightly inform and teach the underſtanding what is juſt and right, but the certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of does keep the judgment ſteddy, and unexpoſed to thoſe fits of variation and inſtability, which thoſe that are directed by no certain principles, are ſubject to; for it is not eaſie for them to vary, who have any fixed rules to guide them: So that if this Law were duly applied by thoſe onely that are learned in it (ſince it is not poſſible to be done by any other ſort of men) neither ignorance, nor errour, nor arbitrarineſs, nor uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of juſtice, nor the conſequences thereof, wrong, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or oppreſſion would be found, at leaſt they would not be ſo frequent and common, as where the guidance and light of ſuch a Law is wanting.</p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe foregoing reaſons, there are yet further and much ſtronger reaſons to be added, why thoſe matters and cauſes, which before the preſent change of government did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the trial and determination of the Civil Law, ſhould be kept within the ſame cogniſance ſtill, theſe alterations notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Firſt, becauſe for many hundreds of years, that and no other has been the ſtanding, approved, and practiſed Law in thoſe matters, and therefore in that regard to be preferred before any new Law, though better, if ſuch a one could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be found. Secondly, becauſe if it ſhould be laid aſide, it would be ſo impoſſible to finde a better, that we ſhould find no Law or rule at all, to put in the room thereof, that would be able to decide them with any tolerable diſcretion or knowledge. The profeſſours of the Municipal Law muſt acknowledge, that their Book caſes (the onely learning of their Law) muſt needs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100164:99"/>here fail them, when not any of thoſe matters were ever judg'd or tried before them. Where then would the Law or rule be found? And ſurely from that we have before ſaid, it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconvenient to commit the triall of them to ſuch as have neither Law or knowledge proper for the determination of them. Thirdly, becauſe thereby ſo eminent and ſo uſeful a profeſſion might be kept up; which elſe to the great diſhonour and dammage of this Nation muſt irrecoverably fall, and be quite extinct. Fourthly, becauſe if theſe things were ſuffered to go on in their accuſtomed way, it would make this great change of State to be the leſs, which in all alterations is to be wiſhed and ſought after. Fifthly, becauſe there was nothing in the nature of thoſe cauſes to tie them to the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely; but that they may be tried under the name and authority of the preſent government, and yet as much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of the Civil Law, as they were before; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Civil Law is fitted to act under any government. It can ſerve the Church, as well as the State; the Popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the Regall; and the Ariſtocratical, as well as either; as we ſhall clearly find if we look into the States abroad, as <hi>France, Spain,</hi> the Empire, the Territories of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the States of the Low Countreys, the States of <hi>Italy,</hi> the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe differing in point of government does not hinder, but that the Civil Law is uſed and practiſed in them all.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon whereof is, becauſe it meddles not with matters of government at all, but was originally made to order the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs of the people, and to judge the matter of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party onely; as may appear by the very ſtate and purport of the Laws themſelves, which are as anſwers made to queſtions onely concerning matters of private right and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as they did ariſe from time to time, during the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Roman Empire. Beſides, the Romans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after they had expulſed their Kings, ſaw ſeveral kindes of government, and yet the Civil Law ſerved under them all. And if it did not ſtand indifferent in this point of government, ſo many Princes and States herein very much diſagreeing, would not ſo freely admit it into their Territories, as they do; for can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100164:100"/>we think, that they would conſent to the admittance of any thing that might endanger their government? So that it is clear, the change of government that has been amongſt us, does not at all hinder, but that as long as the ſame cauſes as well Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time as others, do remain, and muſt neceſſarily have a Trial, the Civil Law, that tried them before, is the fitteſt Law to try them ſtill.</p>
                     <p>It is of as little force and moment, and ought to hinder no more, which is objected, That the Civil Law is a forreign Law, not ordained by the Legiſlative power and authority of this Nation; and therefore very inconvenient it may ſeem, that matters ariſing here ſhould be ordered by any other Law, then which is of our own making, or that we ſhould be made to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any other. Beſides, to have two Laws tolerated in one State, may cauſe great diſtraction and uncertainty amongſt the people, who may under ſeveral pretences be troubled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented under both for one and the ſame thing. Further, the entertaining of the Civil Law, may in time be a means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and undermine the Municipal Law and cuſtomes of this Nation.</p>
                     <p>For as to its being a forreign Law, what is it more in that, then the Laws of the Saxons, Danes, and Normans; of the which our Engliſh Antiquaries, <hi>Cambden,</hi>

And yet it is not ſuch a ſtranger amongſt us neither, as may be conceived; for not onely Antiquity will tell us, that when the Romans were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of this Nation, and during the continuance of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and power here (which was no leſs then 500 years) all the affairs of this Nation were ordered and carried on by the Roman Civil Law; and had no Law to aſſiſt, much leſs to check it in all that time.<note n="e" place="margin">Cambdens Britan. fo. 63.

                     <p>Moreover, if we will deal in forreign affairs, and lanch forth into the wide Ocean, and converſe with forreign people, and have to do with ſhipping, negotiation, and traffick, without which (ſo populous are we grown) we are not able ſo much as to ſubſiſt or live; or if we would be enabled to ſtand upon our own defence againſt a Nation that ſhall aſſault us by a war; or revenge unſufferable injuries done us by making war upon them; we muſt not then ſtand upon our own Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, to which other Princes and people will not be obliged;<note n="h" place="margin">Conſuetudines vel ſtatuta ſunt localia, &amp; ſic non obligant niſi ſubditos. <hi>Gail. obſ. lib. 2. obſ. 124. nu. 5.</hi>
                        </note> but we muſt be contented to ſtand and ſubmit our ſelves to ſuch a Law how forreign ſoever, as is proper for thoſe very matters, and to which other Nations do refer themſelves; which is the Civil Law, that Nature has breathed out it ſelf in, and Nations have conſented unto.</p>
                     <p>And if it be ſo neceſſary for the carrying on of forreign affairs, that they cannot be tranſacted without it, this ſhews a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of admitting of it alſo in the agitation of certain matters and cauſes at home and amongſt our ſelves, for the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reward and encouragement of that profeſſion; which can
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100164:101"/>never be maintained or upheld by the tranſaction of forreign affairs onely; which is not deſired neither in any greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or meaſure, then has been alwayes allowed it heretofore, and where the Common-Law has never known to intermeddle: and in which if the Civil Law ſhould not be uſed, queſtions and differences would ariſe, and there would be no Law or Rule found to ſettle them, which would be a very pernicious thing: So that be the authority of the Civil Law forreign, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, except it were impoſed upon us by ſome other Nation or people; or be it that it were of no authority at all, but what the neceſſary aſſent of our own natural reaſon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Nations gives it; yet it were ſtrange that we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to have no Law at all in thoſe matters, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or entertain the ſame for a help to direct our judgments in them.</p>
                     <p>It being then ſo neceſſary a Law, that but by the knowledg and conduct thereof forreign affairs cannot poſſibly be carried on, and there would be a manifeſt failer of juſtice in other matters at home without it, the ſuppoſed inconvenience of having two Laws in one and the ſame Nation, ſo much urged againſt it, will appear to be a very ſlender and inconſiderable thing; for how can that inconvenience hurt us more, then it does other Nations, that have Municipal Laws of their own, and yet do keep the Civil Law too? Beſides, it is ſo far from being an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it is both a benefit and an honour to a people to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in juſtice, and to have it rather ſupplied by two Laws, then to fail in the doing thereof by having but one.</p>
                     <p>And though where there be two Laws, and two diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of them in one State, if the matters and cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are ſeverally allowed the cognizance, be not certainly aſſigned to each, that the one may not enterfire with the other, there may ariſe a confuſion of juriſdictions, and the ſubject will be uncertain whither to goe for juſtice, and may be in danger to be moleſted by both Courts for one and the ſame thing, which were an intollerable miſchief:<note n="i" place="margin">Gravius pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatorum damno peccatur, eùm inter ſummos magiſtratus, curiaſve majores de imperio cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur. <hi>Bodin. de rep. lib. 3. ca. 6.</hi>
                        </note> Yet the Courts of the Civil Law have alwayes had their limits particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly preſcribed them, and the cauſes within their cogniſance punctually ſet down; and if they hold plea of any thing elſe,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100164:101"/>there is a known remedy to be had to ſtop them, by bringing prohibitions from the Common-Law, which are never ſo ſoon ask'd, as granted. But if the Common-Law Courts ſhall draw to their examination ſuch matters as do properly belong to the Civil, (as they have done too often) or do prohibit the Civil from proceeding, where they know they can do no right nor give any relief themſelves, as in the buſineſs of allotting porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt the deceaſeds kindred, which they never did nor can do, nor will ſuffer the Civil Law Courts to do it neither, this an heavy vexation, but the blame muſt lie upon them. But to be ſure, whileſt there is ſuch a correcting hand over the Courts of the Civil Law, there is little ground of fear that they can trouble or moleſt the people further then their juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er does authoriſe them. Which may be ſufficient alſo to remove the jealouſies of thoſe that fear, if the Civil ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it may in time ſupplant and undermine the Municipal Law of this Nation: For it were a vain attempt for ſubordinate Courts to go about to ſhake the ſtanding of that Law, to whoſe check and controule they lie continually ſubject.</p>
                     <p>And if in forreign Nations (that have their Municipal Laws all of them, but no profeſsion, nor Lawyers, nor Judges, but of the Civil Law onely) there is not any found ſo bold and preſumptuous, that dares at any time to ſet up the Civil Law above the particular Law or Cuſtome of the place, though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do it are not wanting, but that the particular Law or Cuſtome, if any be in the caſe, does prevail, and has the praeeminence alwayes; ſurely then the Municipal Law and cuſtomes of <hi>England</hi> are much more ſecure from being inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and incroched upon, when not onely the Law is diſtinct, but there is a diſtinct profeſsion thereof alſo from the Civil Law, that bears a watchfull eye towards its own greatneſs, and which is more, that has a controuling power, and as it were a ſovereignty over the other. Beſides, the very principles of the Civil Law do run clean counter to any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it being an expreſs Maxime in that Law, That the Municipal Law and cuſtome of any State for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thoſe that are ſubject to it, ought to be preferr'd before any more Univerſal Law that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </note> And as I have ſaid before often, ſo I muſt inculcate it here ſtill; The Civil Law, where ever it is admitted, it comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt prejudice to any, either Law, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, or government, nor alters any thing; but is an auxiliary ſupplement or a knowledg aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the adminiſtration of right and juſtice both to ſubjects, and between Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there is no Municipal Law in the caſe, or where it is imperfect and obſcure, or where a locall Law is of no authority at all. In the one it ſupplies, in the other it interprets, in the laſt it moderates, as a moſt indifferent Umpire.</p>
                     <p>So that of theſe two Laws the proper office and function is, without drawing ſeveral wayes, and claſhing one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or queſtioning each others power, ſweetly to joyn both in that moſt excellent and divine work of juſtice, which may render the people of this Nation moſt quiet within themſelves, and honourably eſteemed by others.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly, there is a ſtrange conceit that has got into the heads of ſome men, That the Civil and Canon Law are one and the ſame, that they cannot be ſevered that if the one be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the other will have acceſs alſo, and the letting in of the Canon Law, which was ordained by the Popes and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will open a wide gap to introduce all their ſuperſtition, erroneous doctrine, and prelatical diſcipline; and ſo in time we ſhall become wholly Romiſh and Antichriſtian. And truly I muſt confeſs, that ſuch a cauſe, that might produce ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an effect, is not to be neglected, but is to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look'd after. But as in the one the ſuppoſition is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken, ſo there is no ſuch cauſe of fear in the other, nor any ſuch danger as is ſurmiſed: for that theſe two Laws are the ſame, or that they are inſeparable, is more then a ſmall miſtake. They were made at ſeveral times, long diſtant each from other, by ſeveral authors, and for ſeveral ends and purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The Civil Law, after it had been growing by degrees in a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100164:102"/>very long proceſs of time, as well under the people, when <hi>Rome</hi> was a free State, as under the Emperours; being become vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous and indigeſted, the choyceſt thereof was pickt out and laid together, by <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> and that Collection was perfected in the year 533, and made the Law of the Empire, whereof <hi>Rome</hi> was now no part or member, but become the land of the Church, the place for the Popes and Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſit in. Who though they made canons for the rule of the Church and Church-men long before, yet the Canon Law, that is now ſo ſtyled, came not forth into the world till above 500 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the firſt part thereof, which is <hi>Gratians</hi> decree, being not publiſhed till the year 1151.</p>
                     <p>The intent and purpoſe of the Civil Law was, to order and direct all the Civil affairs of the great and ſpacious Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: And the buſineſs of the Canon Law was to guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical matters of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> the one was ordained to rule a State, the other to diſcipline a Church. Theſe conſiderations then dividing and ſetting apart theſe two Laws each from other, do manifeſtly ſhew, that they are neither the ſame, nor for the ſame end made, nor yet inſeparable; for if that mighty State of the Romans could man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and carry on ſo much buſineſs as they dealt in, by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law onely, what need has any leſſer Nation now to make uſe of the Canon Law at all? Beſides, there has been alwayes ſuch a contention between theſe two Laws for ſuperiority, and which ſhould have moſt eſteem with the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> that they have been rather ready to fight as foes, then unite and agree as friends. Nay, Mr <hi>Selden</hi>

                     <p>And whoſoever does take a ſurvey of the Canon Law in the Titles above mentioned, and in divers others, he ſhall finde it moſt taken out, and ſpeak the very language of the Civil Law: and ſo much is noted and obſerved all along by the very Gloſs and Canoniſts themſelves. So that hereby the Canon Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100164:103"/>to be of little uſe, when for the ordering of thoſe matters, we may be ſupplied from the fountain it ſelf, from whence the Canon Law has got it. But ſuppoſe there were ſuch a neceſſary concomitancy between theſe two Laws, and that the uſe and practiſe of the one would be a ſure inlet to the other, as ſome do too fondly imagine; does it therefore follow, that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and ſuperſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs creep in too? No more ſurely, then it follows, that becauſe the old Law, that is full of Jewiſh rights and ceremonies, is joyned to the Goſpel, and that we read both together, we muſt therefore preſently all become Jews.</p>
                     <p>And thus having ſatiſfied all ſcruples, that are uſually made againſt the continuing the Civil Law within this Nation; I ſhall but ſhut up all in this concluſion: That ſeing the Roman State, out of their wonderful wiſdome and great experience in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the ſeveral affairs of the World, did deviſe a Law not onely proper for themſelves, but ſo mainly uſeful to other Nations alſo; and that the induſtry of the learned working upon that foundation, has by method, order, Rules, expoſitions, illuſtrations, and treatiſes of all kinds, reduced it to a perfect and compleat Art and Science of Law, whereby the right skill and way of doing the pureſt and moſt natural juſtice, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the caſe be, may be taught and known; And when it has from thence been ingrafted into our own and the other Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> and made one of the three chief Sciences there, to which the reſt of the Arts ſerve as it were as handmaids and ſervants; and all for the directing of men and Nations, how they ſhould deal honeſtly and uprightly with one another; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo that our very Martial affairs cannot proceed wel, nor be rightly regulated without it; and that thoſe Nations whom we have moſt dealings and intercourſe withall, and to whom we ſhould deſpiſe to be any whit inferiour, do not onely keep it, but alſo have no other profeſſion of Law beſides it, and do think their own private Laws to be very inſufficient and lame without it; and that divers matters and cauſes amongſt our ſelves will remain without any Law at all, except the Civil Law be kept to order them, as it did before; Laſtly, when the Civil Law comes to help and aſſiſt, and not to infringe or take away from the Municipal Law at all: If we ſhall now abandon it, and caſt it
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100164:104"/>out of our coaſts, or which is all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, if we ſhall reward and encourage it ſo ſlenderly, that no man will either think it worth his pains to ſtudy, or his coſt to take any degree in it (to which paſs it is moſt viſibly come already) I ſay, if we ſhall ſtill thus neglect or deſpiſe it either way; we ſhall not onely ſet light by the Policy and Wiſdome of the Romans, which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people are ſtudious to imitate and come as near as poſſibly they can; but we ſhall alſo deprive our ſelves of one excellent means to improve our knowledge and reaſon by; our juſtice without it, being guided by illiterate and irrational principles, will be leſs ſatisfactory to the people; our skill in the diſcipline of War, and in the Laws of Armes will be very defective; the very harmony of learning, that has ſo long flouriſhed amongſt us, will be diſſolved, when ſo conſiderable a part as the Civil Law is broken off from it; other Nations will grow too wiſe and ſubtil for us, and will turn and winde us as they lift; and our juſtice at home will be lamed, not being competent enough for the matters we deal in. The conſequence of all which will be, miſchief at home, and diſhonour abroad, which all good Patriots and lovers of their Countrey will lament to ſee.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I am far from having any ſuch opinion of this ſmall Treatiſe, (indeed not deſerving that name, being in great part but an epitomized Collection, and the reſt brief <hi>Memoranda's</hi> or Notes, rather to excite others to proceed upon that Subject, then to reſt on this:) though if by this, or any other Act of mine, any acceſſe of Honour could accrue to your Lordſhip, I hold my ſelf juſtly obliged humbly to preſent and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. But, my Lord, the full ſcope of my intention in this Model is, to the beſt of my Judgment, (which I alwayes ſubmit to better) and of my skill and power, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething tending to the further happineſſe and continuance of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> with <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> in this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> now by Gods bleſsing (to whom be all Honour and Praiſe) <hi>ex poſt-liminio,</hi> as it were, freed from Slavery and Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

And, my Lord, knowing you do <hi>Patrizare</hi> that moſt honoured Father of yours, (whoſe Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muſt never periſh, whoſe Loſſe this Church and State have too ſadly felt, but <hi>Quis talia fando, &amp;c.</hi>) and that I may ſay as <hi>Tertullian (de Reſurrectione carnis)</hi> ſayes of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> raiſed out of the aſhes of his dead Sire, <hi>Alter idem.

                  <p>SOme account may perhaps be expected to be given of this ſmall endeavour, touching the paſsing that Act of clearing the doubt touching Coercive Power in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical; wherein is that <hi>Proviſo</hi> that <hi>forbids all Eccleſiaſticall Judges to tender or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter an Oath to any perſon</hi> Ex Officio <hi>or otherwiſe, or</hi> Purgation; <hi>whereby any perſon may confeſſe or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, ſo as to make him or her liable to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or puniſhment.</hi> There were not a few perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends at leaſt to the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that inſulted much (as is touched hereafter) and clamoured of the oppreſsion of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, that hath been (ſay they) all the time before the paſsing of that Act, that took away that Oath: It was ſuitable to their intereſt to call that oppreſsion. When <hi>Brutus</hi> had murdered <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he called him Tyrant; <hi>Ita enim appellari Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem facto ejus expediebat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Velleius Paterculus, Hiſtor. lib. 2.</hi> From the time of paſsing that Act, till within theſe few dayes, I expected from abler pens ſome Vindication of the proceedings of Eccleſiaſticall Courts, as touching ſuch <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Canonical Purgation,</hi> and the lawful andexpedient uſe thereof before that Act; but none that I hear of attempting it: I looked upon the cauſe as a Derelict, took it up, and though (by the late iniquity of the times) I being too much ſeverall wayes unfurniſhed for ſuch a Work; yet, if but to give ſome ſatisfaction to indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men, and to wipe away at leaſt in part cauſeleſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and to ſtir up others to a further proſecution hereof; I conceived I might adventure upon this little Modell or Plat-form, and perhaps more fitly at this time then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:100164:112"/>till a more complete Structure may be raiſed upon this ſubject, if more be needful; being ſo learnedly and fully handled, eſpecially by Doctor <hi>Conſens</hi> ſometimes Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> and that late glory of our Church Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi> lat Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> That I ſhould eſcape from objections and cenſures too, I can ſcarce ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, upon ſuch a Subject as this is, ingrateful to ſuch men as are <hi>haeredes ex aſſe,</hi> to the ancient oppoſers of it, and are inveighers againſt it; and thoſe that executed it, <hi>quos lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerint, oderint,</hi> alwayes excepting the Members of both Houſes of Parliament out of that number. Some too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may diſlike my Dedication of it (though no Act more free then that) as not to ſome of my own profeſsion, or rather to my own moſt Learned and Pious Dioceſan, the Reverend Father in God, Doctor <hi>Robert Sanderſon</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> having relation to him by <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Truſt:</hi> To him and then I ſhould rather have made my addreſſe then Dedication, and have herein conſulted with them, had time and convenience ſerved before I had attempted this, and not carry Owles to <hi>Athens,</hi> go about to give inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, from whom I ſhould rather have received it. But as to that most Noble Perſon, to whom this is inſcribed, though according to his Birth and Education, his motion hath alwayes been in an higher Orbe and Contemplation of affaires of greater moment, more immediately enabling him to ſerve his King and Country: But (they by being ſomewhat more particularly concerned in a great part of the ſubject matter hereof) therefore by ſome may be ſuppoſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and intereſſed. Yet even in the ſubject matter of theſe <hi>Memoranda</hi> he is not unverſed, if not more particularly; yet as comprehended in that generality of Learning and Knowledge, whereto he hath from his younger yeares been habituated to, at the feet of ſuch a States-man, as was his
<pb facs="tcp:100164:112"/>moſt accompliſhed Father, and ſuch Inſtructors as he by his eſpecial and moſt diſcerning choice appointed him; and all this perfected up by moſt advantagious acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by travel and reſidence in forraign parts, amongſt thoſe who are juſtly ranked in the number of the moſt Civil, Learned, and Wiſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo conſequently in the Univerſe; and ſo need not mine or others inſtruction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more then others, not profeſſed Lawyers. But all that is compriſed in this Model, both in the <hi>Memoranda's</hi> and the <hi>Notes,</hi> ſomewhat grounded upon ſome yeares experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I have had, and tending, as before, at leaſt in my well-meaning opinion to the publick good ſolely; is ſo moſt humbly offered to conſideration, if by thoſe in Authority it be thought fit. He is, I conceive, very fit to further and advance this, both in conſideration of his abilities, and his being impowred as others of his noble rank and quality in the Supreme Judicatory of this Kingdom; and by his own Genius and propenſity, willing and deſirous to effect any thing ayming that way, as leſs cannot be expected from the Son of ſuch a Father, and Husband of ſuch a wife, his moſt noble and moſt vertuous Lady, (a pair in reſpect of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual parity of their moſt intenſe conjugal affection, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentizing love to Loyalty, Juſtice and Honour, hereditary vertues flowing in their veines from their moſt Noble Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, Gloriouſly Acting and Suffering Parents; not eaſily parallel'd) and therefore I have not ſo much Dedicated this to him, as ſupplicated his effectual adminicular hand hereto.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole matter as touching my ſelf, this Modell, as alſo, if not more eſpecially <hi>the Notes</hi> ſubjoyn'd; I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had no ſmall ſhare of Sufferings in the time of exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Monarch and Monarchy, and ſo conſequently of joy and gladneſs in the happy Reſtauration of both; in my due gratitude and obligation, both by tie of natural duty,
<pb facs="tcp:100164:113"/>and of God and Mans Laws, have made it part of my ſtudy to endeavour to contribute my well-meaning mite to the publick good, and the prevention ſuch miſeries for the future, as too lately we have had too ſad experience of. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be given of many that have publiſhed their endeavours heretofore to ſuch publick ends, which have not proved ineffectual, and more eſpecially Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> in queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. If in any meaſure never ſo remote, they may any whit help to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that end they aime at; I ſhall be glad of it, and with that true candour ſubmiſsively offering them, alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting as I now do, that if there be any thing herein, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods word Directly or indirectly, or to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Prerogative, or the known Laws of the Land, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical or Temporal, or the politick Government either in Church or State, or which may give juſt offence: I do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abſolutely retract it, as no wayes by me intended or thought of, wiſhing this ſmall taſte may ſtir up others (more able) to make a further and better progreſs in this kind.</p>

Of their practiſes that way here, that moſt Faithful, Learned, and Grave Hiſtorion of ours, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> gives us an account in his Annals of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> printed at <hi>Leyden</hi> in the Low-Countries 1625. It is in the year 1590. After he hath there given a Relation of that ſtupendious and blaſphemous Fanatick <hi>Hackett, of his beginning, how illiterate, inſolent, fierce, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful he was, that meeting one that had been his School-Maſter an ingenuous perſon, under a colour of embracing him bit off his Noſe, and the poor miſerable deformed man, beſeeching him to give it him again, that whilſt it was green and freſh he might ſow it again to his face; he would not do it, but like a dogge ſwallowed it down; and ſo averſe was he to all piety, that, that heavenly Doctrine he had heard in Sermons, he made ſport with it, with his pot-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions on the Ale-benches. Afterwards when he had prodigally waſted his Eſtate which he had got with a Widow whom he had marryed; on a ſudain he claps on the vizard of moſt specious ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, is wholly taken up in hearing Sermons, reading the Scriptures, and pretending to I know not what, heavenly Revelations, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting and extraordinary calling, inſinuated himſelf into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of ſeverall Divines, that with inflamed Zeal, labour'd to bring in the Presbyteriall Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> Geneva, <hi>into the Church of</hi> England, <hi>amongst whom was one</hi> Wigginton <hi>a Miniſter, and if ever any, an haire-brain'd one, and a contemner of Magiſtrates.</hi> Then he goes on and relates <hi>Hacketts</hi> and his Complices moſt horrid and ridiculous madneſs, ſuch as had not ſuch a worthy author and others related it, we might now doubt of the truth of it, as the next Age will probably do of our Modern Fanaticks late pranks: there he relates his fearful blaſphemous ſpeeches, as he expired and was turn'd off the Gallowes, upon whom that pious and Learned Author gives this grave cenſure, <hi>Ita hoſtis humani generis, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentas quos ſanctitatem ſimulare, &amp; ad ſobrietatem nolle ſapere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendit.</hi> Thus the enemy of Mankinde infatuates thoſe whom he perceives to be counterfeitors of holineſs, and will not be wiſe with ſobriety.</p>
                     <p>And then after a line or two upon <hi>Arthington</hi> and <hi>Coppinger,</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100164:117"/>two of <hi>Hacketts</hi> Complices he goes on thus. <q>Nec hii ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, ſed etiam alii, qui receptam in Eccleſia Anglicana Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam, Epiſcoporum vocationem damnando, &amp; Praeſules contumeliosè calumniando, hactenus fruſtra impugnarant.

That is, Not onely theſe, (ſpeaking of <hi>Hackett</hi> and his Complices) but others alſo, who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, though in vain, impugned the received Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by condemning the calling of Biſhops, and contumeliouſly ſlandering the Praelates; having now drawn into their party ſome Common-Lawyers, ſharpned both their Tongues and Pens againſt their Juriſdiction, and the Authority which the Queen delegated in Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes as altogether unjuſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming every where, even in Books publiſhed, that men were unworthily oppreſſed in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, contrary to the Lawes of the Kingdom. That the Queen could not by Law delegate ſuch kinde of Authority, nor others to whom it was delegated could exerciſe it. That theſe Courts could not require the Oath <hi>ex officio</hi> from the defendent party, when as no man is bound to accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. That Oath precipitates men to condemn themſelves with ignominious confuſion, or into wilful perjury to the deſtruction of their Souls. Beſides, they ought not to hold cognizance of any other cauſes then Matrimoniall and Teſtamentary, according to that old Mandate of Reſcript,</q> 
                        <hi>We command our Sheriff of our Counties of</hi> S. N. <hi>&amp;c. that they ſuffer not any in their Balive to come together in any places, to make any Recognizances upon their Oaths, but in Matrimoniall and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100164:118"/>cauſes.</hi> 
                        <q>On the other ſide the Profeſſors of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes maintain'd, the Royall Authority in Cauſes Eccleſiaſticall as veſted in the Queen by Authority of Parliament. To oppoſe this, was nothing elſe then to offer violence to Royall Majeſty, and violating the Oath of obedience, to inſult over the Sacred Prerogative Royall. The Eccleſiaſticall Courts may hold cognizance of other Cauſes, then Matrimoniall and Teſtamentary, by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis</hi> and <hi>Artiouli Cleri,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt as they made it appeare. That Reſcript or Law which they produc'd was ſuſpected, becauſe it was incertain for the time, and is variouſly read. Elſewhere I have read it, <hi>To perform Recogniſances and Oaths,</hi> and to make recognition or recognizance, doth not ſignifie to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, or to anſwer in Law, but to acknowledge and confeſſe a debt, or to hold plea of Inventaries or Debts. That the Oath <hi>ex officio</hi> hath time out of mind been given in theſe Courts as in others, to ſift out Simonie, Adultery, and other works of darkneſs; eſpecially, when the Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation as they call it, becomes loud.</q> 
                        <hi>And though no man is bound to betray himſelf, yet being betrayed by fame, he is bound to ſhew himſelf whether he can defend his innocence and purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeing the penance enjoyned is not a puniſhment, but a medicine to cure ſinners, and to deter others from ſinning, and to take away ſcandall,</hi> according to that in Scripture, <hi>Be not confounded in speaking truth for thy ſouls ſake, for there is a confuſion that brings ſin, and there is a confuſion that brings glory and grace.</hi> 
                        <q>But what do I dwelling upon theſe things, when the Learned diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hereupon on both ſides are extant of <hi>Richard Coſin</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Lawes, and <hi>John Morris,</hi> and <hi>Lancelot Andrewes?</hi> The Queen not ignorant that Her Authority was in this buſineſs ſtruck at through the ſides of the Biſhops, tacitely cruſn'd the violence of the Adverſaries, and conſerv'd the Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction inviolate.</q> Thus in a few words he ſummes up part of them marrow of theſe Learned diſſertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gives his ſound judgement thereupon. But ſtill they went on in their deſign, in which I believe they will ever be found immoveable. We have had ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100164:119"/>that way at what they aime, and that there is no hope of bending without breaking too. In their admonition to the Parliament in that Queens Reign they tell us, to this effect at leaſt, that if they cannot have what they deſire by fair meanes, they will have it by a way ſhall make our hearts ake; and I think they have indifferently well made their words good. Yet bleſſed be God, we are delivered again from them, god give us care to beware of them, and not to fall again into their ſnares by thoſe bleſſed Titles of Mercy and Moderation, heavenly good ſurely, if rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Let us but contemplate our freſh miſeries, and the murther of our bleſſed King and Martyr, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and his <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, 'tis well to be hoped 'twill prove as much or more effectual, then the Pages <hi>Memento</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> in another caſe. Theſe men, for they were all of the ſame Leaven, ſtill perſiſted in their deſign, all along the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and upon King <hi>James</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, thinking upon that change to have wrought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary upon a Prince that had a great acceſs of Dominion, and probably at his entrance would endeavour to ſatisfie all or moſt, ſo far as with reaſon it could be expected, and to ingratiate himſelf as far as fitting with his new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But it was our happineſs, though his trouble and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation, that he was well acquainted with the factious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious humours of that gang in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (with whom and ours here of the ſame mould, I believe ever was and will be a correſpondence and co-operation.) <hi>Ex virids obſervantia</hi> this is too demonſtrable. They then ſet upon King <hi>Iames</hi> with their moſt humble Petition, called <hi>The Lincoln-ſhire Miniſters Petition,</hi> perhaps <hi>denominatio à majori;</hi> it was a complication of many parts: there they deſire favour for tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and thereupon was the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> granted, where their Reaſons were, as it were, <hi>brayed in a Mortar,</hi> and they or moſt of them ſeem'd ſatisfied; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them at leaſt, ſoon returned to their vomit. In that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they promiſe all obedience, and profeſs they hold it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Word, and the practice of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to reſiſt the Prince, or to get Reformation by force or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100164:119"/>violence. To this effect they ſupplicate and hold forth; yet I believe it may be prov'd, that ſome of theſe individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in that Petition, adhered expreſly to the late Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His Majeſty, if they were not actually in Arms againſt him, as moſt if not all of their Opinions were. How they crept in, or rather marched on furiouſly, though ſlily in the the late King time, till they had weav'd up their Web to their deſire: we have ſeen and ſadly felt. When the High-Commiſſion and Star-Chamber were taken away, a great point was gain'd: To ſpeak of nothing elſe but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon which I am. Yet by the way it is obſervable, that many, if not moſt, moderate men are of opinion, that the Government will not be well ſettled, till both theſe Courts, though happily in many particulars altered and regulated. or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſome other Courts much like them, be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; where extraordinary crimes and perſons may be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and in the former, the High-Commiſſion, the ſhifting of criminous perſons from one Dioceſe to another may be met with. It was no ſmall part of their deſign, to trample upon Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and to take away the coercive power, and to make it precarious and ridiculous: as they would interpret that Statute, which, if credible relations be true, was but ſtrangely got; inſomuch that a great leading Member in the Houſe of Commons then in that long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cryed out, <hi>Digitus Dei ſuit in eo;</hi> that though it were not intended, yet the words would bear it, which he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at; though many, and not of the leaſt, able Lawyers in the Kingdom were not of his opinion. That Coercive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for no other have the Eccleſiaſtick Courts, (except <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenſion,</hi> a degree below it, which amounts but to a ſmall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion to refractory perſons, in regard it goes not further, the ſecular arme cannot be called upon that;) that, I ſay, that coercive power is <hi>Excommunication.</hi> That is the power of the Keyes, how far that power may be ſtaid, retarded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, I intend not to diſpute; but that it ſhall be totally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the Church, <hi>Quaſinon eſſet Deus in coelis,</hi> that ſurely is not to be believed, that it can be done by any power under Heaven. But that taking away that coercive power
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100164:120"/>from the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, as they interpreted it, (and they knew they had <hi>argumentum à fortiori</hi> to maintain it) did not a little further and heighten their deſign. At the time of their raiſing their Militia againſt the late King, a perſon of no mean quality at a great Aſſembly made his Harangue to the people, (as I heard it from a very credible perſon, who ſaid he was then and there preſent and heard it) and then and there enumerated the many great bleſſings this Nation had received from that bleſſed Parliament, (as he call'd it) That Ship-money was taken away, and the Star-Chamber was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the High-Commiſſion was taken away, and the Spiritual Courts too are taken away: A man could not meddle with a Wench, (his expreſſion was otherwiſe, which I am not willing to mention) but he muſt be queſtion'd: <hi>Hinc illae lacrymae.</hi> Indeed that was a great Eye-ſore. Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents never love the Judges that puniſh them.</p>
                     <q>At laus ſumma, viris displicuiſſe malis.</q>
                     <p>And this did not a little advantage the cauſe they had then in hand, very many perſons that had been juſtly queſtion'd in theſe Courts flocking in to their colours. But I take no delight to rekon up theſe ſtrange paſſages, (to call them no worſe) which were not a few when that ſtorm was in raiſing, which afterwards ſhaked all the corners of the Land. Two onely which concerned Eccleſiaſtical proceedings, (to meddle with no other of higher nature, that the world rang of, and I would the memory of them could be perpetually aboliſhed) I ſhall briefly touch, which amongſt others were theſe: A grave and able Civilian, and then a Member of the Houſe of Commons, was accuſed by an Inconformiſt, that he had excommunicated him, for not kneeling at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion when he received. I was preſent, and ſaw and heard it, and to my beſt remembrance it was for not kneeling at the Communion, at leaſt it was for not performing ſome other Ceremony; ſo that as to this matter 'tis all one. the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian being called up to a Committee of the Lords, then in the Long Parliament, out of the Houſe of Commons, to anſwer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100164:120"/>it. By his Counſel he deſir'd time to ſend into the Countrey, where it was pretended to be done, to know whether he had done any ſuch thing; it being impoſſible for him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber every particular that he had done in his juriſdiction, and that particular, he ſaid, he did not remember. He had time given, and informed himſelf thereof; and at the next appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time of his appearanee, by his Counſel, pleaded that he had done no ſuch thing, as he was accuſed of. The Accuſer ſaid, then it was done by his Deputy or surrogate: That was denyed too. Then he ſaid, he was ſure it was done by the Spiritual Court; and ſo it was, but not by any Spiritual Court where that Civilian had to do: Then the Civilian pleaded, that if he had done that whereof he was accuſed, he doubted not but he could have juſtified it: but ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he was unjuſtly accus'd, and reap'd ſome diſcredit by being thus queſtion'd, and had been put to trouble and charge thereabouts, he deſired reparation and charges: which by many of the Lords was yielded to, yet by the major part it was carried, that he ought not to have it; and the reaſon was rendred, becauſe it would deter others from complaining.
<q>Si ſatis eſt accuſaſſe, quis erit innocens?</q> Nay, how far may it tend to the ruine of ſome, if ſome men be maliciouſly ſet upon them, to multiply accuſations againſt them?</p>
                     <p>The other was: Another Inconformiſt complaining of his being queſtion'd in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts for his Inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: In defence it was alledged againſt him and proved, that he had ſaid, <hi>He would as ſoon how at the name of</hi> Judas, <hi>as at the Name of</hi> JESUS: and I diligently enquir'd, but never heard he was puniſh'd for it. But would there had been no more then theſe, though theſe are too much: Would ſome had not gloried, had not triumphed in their ſhame.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BY the late Act before mentioned, where the <hi>Doubt</hi> (ſo it is called there) about the Coercive power in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts is clear'd and taken away.</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Proviſo</hi> is, <hi>That that Act, nor any thing therein conteined, ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to extend, to give unto any Archbiſhop or Biſhop, or any other Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Judge, &amp;c. any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or authority to exerciſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any be peccant that way, it ought to be amended.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Proviſo forbids any Archbiſhop, Biſhop, &amp;c. to tender or adminiſter unto any perſon the Oath uſually called the Oath</hi> Ex officio, <hi>or any other Oath, whereby ſuch perſon, to whom the ſame is tendred or adminiſtred, may be charged or compelled to confeſs or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or to purge him or her ſelf of any criminal matter or thing, whereby he or ſhe may be lyable to any cenſure or puniſhment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being now forbidden by Act of Parliament, every Subject ought to give obedience therein: But ſome now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and upbraiding the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, that all this while they have oppreſſed the Subject, with that proceeding which the Parliament hath taken away renewing the old cry in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and ever ſince againſt ſuch procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which never till now (I alwayes except what was done in the late times of uſurped government) were legally prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100164:121"/>Though I am far from queſtioning the reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that Act paſſed, but do humbly ſubmit to it both in word and practice; yet I hope it will be allowed to make ſome defence againſt ſuch perſons, as ſo tax ſuch proceedings before the paſſing of this Act. And herein I ſhall follow that moſt able Civilian, <hi>Richard Coſin</hi> Doctor of the Laws, and Dean of the Arches, in that his <hi>Apology for ſundry proceedings by Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> as before, mentions him with honour, as ſurely he well deſerv'd, and that work of his, if nothing elſe, evinces it. Mr. <hi>Swinburn</hi> in that Work of his of <hi>Laſt Wills and Teſtaments,</hi> printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the Company of Stationers, 1611. in the firſt part, ſect. 6. numb. 8. fol. 17. writes thus of him, and of that Work of his, that Apology: <hi>I find,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>written by that learned and no leſs religious man, Doctor</hi> Coſins <hi>(at I take it) in that worthy Work entituled, An Apology for ſundry proceedings by Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he goes on. Upon this ſubject he hath written ſo fully, that, I believe, little can be added to it; and if any ſhould go about it (excepting ſuch additions as well may be added, by reaſon of ſome emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſince the time he wrote, and ſome other additions and explications, not derogatory from him) they would be forced very much to plough with his Heyfer, which would but look too much like a Plagiary. I could wiſh the book were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and haply it will be ſo, which may ſerve for Topicks to this ſubject. For as all the Poets after <hi>Homer</hi> are ſaid to drink of his Fountain, according to that picture or ſtatue of his, that denotes as much, with that Inſcription,
<q>Ridet anhelantem poſt ſe veſtigia turbam.</q>

                     <p>Even ſo muſt, I conceive, all do from Doctor <hi>Coſin,</hi> that ſhall write upon this ſubject. I was upon Epitomizing that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of his, and had made ſome progreſs therein; but upon ſecond thoughts deſiſted, thinking it better to refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, rather then to adventure to abbreviate him, and thereby perhaps wrong him: an offence that too many Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizers are guilty of; therefore, I ſay, I ſhall onely make
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100164:122"/>uſe of ſome Notes, as confeſſed arrows out of his quiver, and ſippe of ſome others elſewhere, and point the Reader to his full ſtream, where any that liſt may drink their fill.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe words in the late Act; <hi>Provided, that this Act., nor anything therein contained, ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or give unto any Archbiſhop, Biſhop, &amp;c. any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to exerciſe or execute, &amp;c. any juriſdiction which they might not have done before the year of our Lord</hi> 1639. <hi>or to abridge or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Kings Majeſties Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical matters or affairs, nor to confirm the Canons made in the year</hi> 1640.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, upon theſe words ſome are ready (miſtaking queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs the words and meaning of that Act) to renew that old exploded Opinion, or rather groundleſs Fancy, <hi>That a ſeveral Royal aſſent to the executing of every particular Canon is required.</hi> Hereto Doctor <hi>Coſin</hi> anſwers, That admitting This were true, then all the other opinions of thoſe that oppugn the ordinary Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical ſtand in no ſtead, and might be ſpared, becauſe this would cut off all at once. For none that exerciſe ordinary Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, have it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity, (which by the oppugners ſeems to be meant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by permiſſion of Law, to every of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and impoſſible were it, by reaſon of the infinity of it, and troubleſomneſs to procure ſuch particular aſſent to the execution of every Canon. His Majeſties Delegates, when Appeals are made to His Majeſty in Chancery, would ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, could not exerciſe the power to them delegated, by reaſon of the want of ſuch particular aſſent; and it is a groſs abſurdity to grant, (as even the Oppugners and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators do) <hi>That Teſtamentary and Matrimonial cauſes are of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cognizance,</hi> (to ſay nothing of the reſt of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes) and yet cannot by reaſon of this want be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor can be dealt in by any other authority, according to any Law in force. This would ſpeak a defect in the publick Government, that the Subject ſhould have a right, but no likely or ready mean to come by it; and great offences by Law puniſhable, and yet no man ſufficiently authorized to execute theſe Laws. Since the abrogation of Papal pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Supremacy, when the ancient rights of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100164:122"/>of being <hi>Supreme Governors over all perſons within their Dominions, as well in all spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical things or cauſes, as Temporal; and that no forreign Prince, Perſon, Prelate, State or Potentate, hath or ought to have, any juriſdiction, power, ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preeminence or authority Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual within this Realm, and ſo forth,</hi> as in the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Oath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since theſe rights were, as it were, <hi>ex poſtliminio</hi> reſtored, and declared to have been, as they ever ought to have been, in the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> many Laws have been made in ſeveral Parliaments for the ſtrengthning of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more effectual execution thereof, and ſome of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws were enlarged, altered and explained:</p>

But never was there any Law, Cuſtom or Act of Parliament, that required <hi>a ſeveral Royal aſſent to the executing of every particular Canon.</hi> Many are the reaſons which Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> gives in the firſt Chapter of his Apology againſt that <hi>particular Aſſent;</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100164:123"/>wherein he ſhews his great candor, and ingenuity, and deſire to give abundant ſatisfaction to all Opponents, though never ſo unreaſonable, that were it not as clear as the Noon-tide light, that no ſuch particular aſſent is needful, ſome might think that he fear'd his cauſe, and be ready to ſay, that <hi>Deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio nimis operoſa, reatum quaſi arguit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But touching the validity of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, there needs, I conceive, no more be ſaid then what is expreſſed in that Act of Parliament 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8.19. the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, that were in uſe and practice before that Statute, are thereby eſtabliſhed thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Provided that ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions, Ordinances and Synods Provincial, being already made, which be not contrariant nor repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws, Statutes and Cuſtoms of this Realm, nor to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or hurt of the Kings Prerogative Royal, ſhall now ſtill be uſed and execrated, as they were before the making of this Act, untill ſuch time as they be viewed, &amp;c. by the</hi> 32. <hi>perſons mentioned in that Act:</hi> which is not yet done.</p>
                     <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Laws, which have been made ſince that Act, and all that ever hereafter ſhall be made, ſo long as tht Statute ſtands in force, (the requiſites in that Act being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) are thereby, I conceive, confirmed, or to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Submiſſion and Petition of the Clergy mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Act is, <hi>That they would not enact or put in ure any new Canons, &amp;c. in their Convocation, without the Kings Royal aſſent and authority in that behalf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There it is ſaid, That <hi>the Convocation in the time coming ſhall alwayes be aſſembled by authority of the King Writ, and that the Clergy muſt have the Kings moſt royal aſſent and licence, to make, promulge, and execute ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions and Ordinances, Provincial and Synodal:</hi> elſe they may not enact, promulge or conſtitute any ſuch Canons, &amp;c. And this courſe hath ever ſince been obſerved. Every Convocation called by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Writ and the Clergy, had eſpecial licenſe from His Majeſty to enact ſuch Canons, &amp;c. and to execute them.</p>
                     <p>The Proviſion following being obſerved, which is this, <hi>Provided that no Canons, Conſtuurions or Ordinances, ſhall be made or put in execution in this Realm by authority of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100164:123"/>of the Clergy, which ſhall be contrariant or repugnant to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, or the Cuſtoms, Laws or Statutes of this Realm, any thing contained in that Act to the contrary thereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any be put in execution contrary to this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> and contrary to any after-Acts of Parliament, whereby His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hath further power acknowledged in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, then 'tis illegal: but that is much ſooner alledged than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The particular Eccleſiaſtical Laws in force, have by Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> and others been ſufficiently demonſtrated, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive. In caſe any Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil within this Realm, be not derived or claimed from the Crown, as to the execution of it at leaſt; then the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection were of force; but another Act of Parliament, 8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. ſhews the contrary ſufficiently: where all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction is acknowledged United to the Crown, as there fully: and that very clauſe 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. together with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Letters Patents directed forth for confirming Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Biſhops, is brought in the preamble thereof as a ſtrong proof, without ſcruple or ambiguity, that <hi>the authority and juriſdiction by the Clergy executed, is thereby given them from Her Majeſty.</hi> This alſo, were there nothing elſe, were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to entitle them the Kings Majeſties Eccleſiaſtical Laws, as well as other Laws, are called the Kings Majeſties Laws. But they are up and down in the Acts of Parliament called the Kings and the Queens Eccleſiaſtical Laws, 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. 5 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 25. 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and even by the Note ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, that great oppugner, againſt whom the Doctor wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, they are called <hi>the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of England.</hi> And in this late Act above mentioned they are called <hi>the Kings Majeſties Eccleſiaſtical Laws.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet for executing of theſe Laws by the Eccleſiaſtical Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, what out-cries were made againſt them? eſpecially in the beginning of the late Long Panliament, by His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, of bleſſed memory, called the <hi>Black Parliament, Summa imis miſcendo;</hi> and what favours were then afforded to thoſe <hi>Boutefeu's,</hi> as we have ſince had ſad experience of them, God grant we may be cafeful of them for the future, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100164:124"/>to recite. Eccleſiaſtical Judges are not onely tyed by their offices and<note n="*" place="margin">Canon. 117.

                     <argument>
                        <p>By the late Act, the manner of proceeding in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts, is not altered, but left as it was. A Summary relation of what Doctor <hi>Coſens</hi> in his Apology hath aſſerted and made good by Gods word, the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, the opinion of the Fathers, the Laws Canon and Civil, and the Laws of the Land allowing and warranting them. The like practice at Common Law, and at <hi>Geneva</hi> and other places, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſtrict Reformation.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS to the proceeding <hi>Ex officio,</hi> or otherwiſe in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts, according to Law and the due former practiſe, nothing in that late Act is ſaid againſt it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore implicitly, at leaſt, it is allowed and approved. <hi>Rati ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitio mandato aequiparatur,</hi> 'tis a Rule of Law. The Law in that caſe remains at it was before, nothing need be ſaid in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, but only as touching the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> or other Oath, not to be adminiſtred as there, and touching Purgation.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Proviſo's</hi> in that late Act, that which forbids Eccleſiaſtical Judges, to exerciſe any power, &amp;c. as there; and that other <hi>Proviſo</hi> that forbids <hi>them to tender,</hi> or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto any perſon whatſoever, the Oath uſually called the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> or any other Oath whereby ſuch perſon to whom the ſame is tendred or adminiſtred, may be charged or compelled to confeſs, or accuſe him or her ſelf of any crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal matter or thing, whereby he or ſhe may be lyable to any cenſure or puniſhment. I ſay, touching the former <hi>Proviſo</hi> he hath, I conceive, given full ſatisfaction in that his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in anſwering to the objeetions made in his time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. Therein alſo he clearly and fully juſtifies the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Eccleſiaſtical Courts in general and particular caſes. And to that other <hi>Proviſo</hi> touching the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> or any other Oath; and touching Purgation, as in that Act,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100164:129"/>I humbly conceive, <hi>ſalvo meliore judicio,</hi> he fully and clearly evinces it, that the law and practice thereof was juſt, to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and adminiſter the Oat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> or Simony, Adultery, and other crimes and deeds of darkneſs, <hi>difficidimae probationis,</hi> ſo that evil may be removed from the Land. Alwayes provided that there was juſt cauſe for the Eccleſiaſtical Judge ſo to tender and adminiſter that Oath; that is, that there was, before ſuch oath was ſo adminiſtred or tendered to any party, due proof made of a common fame, that the party was guilty of ſuch crime, touching which ſuch oath was to be miniſtred; or at leaſt there was, as in ſome caſes, <hi>denunciatio Evangelica,</hi> or <hi>canonica,</hi> or <hi>inſinuatio clamoſa,</hi> or other ſufficient <hi>indicia prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionis</hi> or <hi>ſuspicionis,</hi> to induce the Judge to tender that oath; and ſo the practice alwayes was, and if it ever was otherwiſe, (as I believe that will ſcarcely be proved) it ought not to have been. He ſets down the due cautions that ought to be had, when it is very probable that the perſon to whom that oath is tendered, will forſwear himſelf, then to forbear it; and that in capital crimes, to the danger of loſs of life or limb, it is not the practice in any Courts to adminiſter ſuch oath, for that very fear of Perjury; it being too much to be feared, that too too many would rather forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then endanger either life or limb, (though in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture it appears, that even in ſuch caſes ſuch oaths have been adminiſtred.) The Father of lies could ſpeak truth in ſuch a caſe,<note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note>

That a man is not properly ſaid to betray or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, when as publick fame, or other ſufficient <hi>indicia,</hi> preſumptions or ſuſpicions have accuſed him, theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the accuſers: and it ſeems diſ-ingenuous at leaſt, in thoſe eſpecially that pretend to Learning, and have or might have examined the Canons, and Eccleſiaſtical Laws in that point, to urge one piece of a ſentence and leave out the reſt;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100164:130"/>where they found or might have found that ſentence, <hi>Nemo tenetur ſeipſum prodere</hi> or <hi>accuſare,</hi> they did alſo or might have found that which follows in that ſentence, viz. <hi>Sed proditus per famam, tenetur ſeipſum oſtendere, &amp; innocentiam ſuam pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As for tendering the Oath to the party where there is an accuſer, that is not done upon the crime till the fame be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or ſufficient preſumptions, circumſtances, <hi>indicia,</hi> or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitions, or <hi>ſemiplena probatio,</hi> the oath of one ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at leaſt, to induce the judge to give that oath, though pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in ſome ſort to the party.</p>
                     <p>This practice he proves conſonant to Gods Word, to the practice of the primitive Chriſtian, and the opinion of the holy Doctors and Fathers of the Church; as alſo conſonant to the practice of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other at leaſt ſeemingly ſtrictly reformed Churches: and to the practice of all Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other Nations not Chriſtian, guided onely by right
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100164:130"/>reaſon and the Law of Nature: as alſo that by the known Laws of this Land, the Eccleſiaſtical Judges were ſo warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commanded to give that oath; the Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Canons being full and clear in that point. Then he ſhews how the proceeding at Common Law in this Land is the ſame, not onely in ſome criminal but civil cauſes alſo. For private debts 'twixt private perſons penal to them, as in Wagers of Law, ſometimes for a greater, ſometimes a leſſer debt, 'twixt two private parties, with the parties oath that is accuſed, and his Compurgators too; even as in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation Canonical in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, together with other Purgation or Deciſory Oaths at Common Law. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Chancery, with the ſeveral ſpecies and kinds of caſes, wherein ſuch Oaths at Common Law are tendered, being very numerous, and are by him <hi>cap.</hi> 6. in the third part of his Apology, and other parts thereof reckoned up, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth. And if this may be done in civil cauſes, ought it not much rather be allowed the Church in criminal, which works onely, <hi>medicinaliter,</hi> to reformation? the Common-wealth works <hi>ad poenam,</hi> the Church not ſo; this to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the party, to bring him to a voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to take away the offence and ſcandal which he hath juſtly given to his Neighbour, and to lead a new life; that (perhaps) to the loſs of liberty, corporal puniſhment, or livelyhood at leaſt, beſides the infamy of being convicted of doing diſhoneſtly and unworthily.</p>

In ſome of theſe above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned inſtances, we ſee how oaths were adminiſtred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in capital cauſes, much more may they be where there is not that danger, nay, no danger of loſſe of Goods, Liberty, or any other loſſe; but onely for a medicine to the ſoul, for reformation of manners, and taking away ſcandal and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given. They were queſtioned too, we ſet, upon ſmall ſu7ſpicions, ſigns, preſumptions, or any other cauſes of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nay, nothing at all as to the perſon queſtioned, upon whom no true colour of ſuſpicion lay, (ſomething like our Coroners proceedings in ſome caſes) but onely a fact was committed, that was apparent, whereof it was poſſible that he was not guilty, as in the caſe of a perſon found ſlain; then much more ought it to be upon great ſuſpicions, preſumptions, or publick fame thereof proved. This being thus by Gods Word, in the next place we may look into the practice and opinion of the primitive Chriſtians hereupon.</p>

So in the Court of Requeſts, in the <hi>Marches of Wales</hi> the court of the Council there, and in the North parts; ſo that to the intent of a Defendants being urged by oath (ſomtimes) to diſcover himſelf in a matter criminal, it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to as much in theſe Courts, as is challenged for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Courts Eccleſiaſtical: and the Chancery muſt needs be the ancienteſt court of this Realm, becauſe from thence all original Writs and commiſſions do come, whereupon the other courts do ground all their proceedings; therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, as in ſundry other points of proceeding there, they drew the exacting of the Defendants anſwer upon oath from the Civil Law: For that court of Chancery being here in time and nature the firſt, (after the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, before the coming in of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was ſhaked off here) it could not take light from other courts of the common Law, but from ſome other, that was before both it and them.

                     <p>Dr. <hi>Coſens,</hi> chap. 3. in the third part of his Apology, writes thus: <hi>The grand Jury</hi> (as I take it) <hi>have their oath given to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and preſent, their own, their fellows, and others faults.</hi> And Part 3. chap. 14. he ſayes, that at Aſſizes and Seſſions Grand Juries <hi>are urged by oath to enquire and preſent Treaſons, Murthers, and other Felonies, breach of the Peace, violation of ſundry Laws and Statutes, Common Nuſances, &amp;c. Now if one of the Grand Jury, being to be ſworn, would deny to take the Oath, except he might have ſome certain offences (uſually given in charge) left out and forepriſed ſeverally out of his Oath, left otherwiſe he ſhould thereby be driven to accuſe himſelf: Or if one ſuppoſed moſt able to give evidence to the Coroners Inqueſt, upon a murther committed, ſhould deſire to be spared from telling his istmoſt knowledge thereof
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100164:139"/>upon his oath,</hi> leſt thereby he be driven to accuſe himſelf: would the Judges ſpare them, and not rather repute them to be guilty of theſe crimes, for which they refuſe to take oath and diſcover their knowledge? And why not then, other men ſhould not, upon crimes nothing ſo penal, who refuſe to take the oath to anſwer them, be judged by any man to do it upon good ground and conſcience?</p>
                     <p>If a Tithingman refuſe to make Preſentment,<note place="margin">10 H. 6.7.</note> the Steward of the court may amerce him.</p>

                     <p>Therefore hereupon may it not be concluded thus? That whatſoever the Eccleſiaſtical Laws do allow and require, being not contrary nor repugnant to the Prerogative Royal, nor to the Laws Statutes and cuſtoms of this Realm, that may be lawfully practiſed by Judges Eccleſiaſtical. But this oath is ſuch, by reaſon that ſundry Temporal courts (by Law) hold the like courſe, and do not prohibite it in Courts Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical; ſo that not being ſo much as divers courſes, they cannot be contrariant or repugnant, therefore theſe oaths were lawfully practiſed in courts Eccleſiaſtical: or thus, That which is juſtice and equity in one court, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt unequal, or cruel in another court, that is thereunto no leſſe authorized than the firſt: But ſuch be theſe Oaths, as appeareth by the practice of the aforementioned Temporal courts, therefore they are lawful and equal alſo in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal courts.</p>

                     <p>Some hold, that by the words of this late Act, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent party, upon whom a fame is unjuſtly raiſed, and the beginning of it cannot be found, as often hath happened, yet though he offer to purge himſelf, the Eccleſiaſtical Judge is not to tender or adminiſter the oath to him; though this ſeems otherwiſe, becauſe the oath is forbidden but onely in ſuch caſes, <hi>whereby the perſon to whom the ſame is tendered or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, may be charged or compelled to confeſs or accuſe, or to purge him or her ſelf, of any criminal matter or thing, whereby he or ſhe may be lyable to any cenſure or puniſhment.</hi> But in this caſe of voluntary offer to take the oath, that reaſon of cenſure or puniſhment ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Volenti non fit injuria neque dolus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Reg. juris.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such courſe by way of oath to find out the ſin being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, how great an encouragement it may prove to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch ſins, is obvious to the eaſieſt judgment. It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to make Adultery puniſhable by death, though that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme be to be avoided the contrary too muſt be ſhunned.</p>
                     <p>If it be lawful at common Law, as in a Wager at Law, and many other caſes, as before touched, to tender and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſuch oaths, and in ſuch cauſes as need it not ſo much, as theſe cauſes ordinarily do; wherein before that late Act it was adminiſtred in Eccleſiaſtical courts: then why not in Eccleſiaſtical courts? Except it be ſaid, that the fame courſe ſhall be taken to forbid it alſo at common Law, which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is not intended; ſince Jury men, as Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in that his Apology affirms, had an oath given them to <hi>preſent their own and their fellows faults.</hi> Now ſuch in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical proceedings.</p>
                     <p>The inequality of the puniſhment as to the difference of Sex. Indeed the permiſſion of puniſhment as to one Sex, the Man, and the puniſhment to the weaker Sex, the Woman,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100164:141"/>who therefore deſerves more commiſeration: that inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſay, cannot at beſt but ſeem ſtrange. For the man will alwayes probably (except either by Gods grace he will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, by confeſſing his fault; or elſe, as before, be taken <hi>in flagranti crimine;</hi> or with ſuch violent preſumption as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) eſcape puniſhment though never ſo guilty: It is <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum concatenatum,</hi> there muſt be two to act it. In that ſin the man without the woman, or the woman without the man, ſignifie no more then the letter <hi>q</hi> without an <hi>u</hi> following it, to make it into a ſyllable. As for the man, his crime is <hi>tranſiens,</hi> leaves no <hi>veſtigia</hi> behind it to diſcover him: not ſo oftentimes in the woman, the infallible <hi>indiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> of her fault, her <hi>crimen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens</hi> appearing to every eye, though ſhe is no more guilty thereof then the man: whom if ſhe rightly name or accuſe, yet that works nothing againſt him, except to keep the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard child as the reputed father thereof; wherein not a few light women probably name not the right father; ſo her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle teſtimony ſerves to puniſh either the right to wrong fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not to take away the ſcandal or evil cauſed by the man that offended. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation hath been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very friendly and favourable to the weaker Sex, and very many are the privileges and honoraries we give them more then in other Nations; for which in the opinion of generous minds we are accounted more honourable then others; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſome have ſaid, <hi>If there were a bridge 'twixt</hi> Dover <hi>and</hi> Callis, <hi>all the women in the Continent would come into our Iſland.</hi> But by this we may ſeem to hazard that honour.</p>
                     <p>In Simony, Uſury, and many other crimes of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cogniſance, be the fame, circumſtances, ſuſpicions, and all other inducements never ſo ſtrong; yet this oath being not to be adminiſtred, the offender ſcapes, neither the evil nor ſcandal is removed.</p>
                     <p>Biſhops by the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. are to give the Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy <hi>ex offieio</hi> to others, or whether it be <hi>ex officio</hi> or <hi>ad inſtantiam partis,</hi> the matter is all one; 'tis forbidden to give it to any perſon, whereby he may <hi>be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or compelled to confeſs,</hi> or accuſe, or to purge him or her ſelf of any criminal <hi>matter or thing, whereby he or ſhe may be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100164:142"/>lyable to any cenſure or puniſhment.</hi> The refuſal of this oath is penal, and perhaps the perſon was ſo accuſed to the Biſhop, or there was a common fame thereof, or other ſufficient inducement to enquire thereof; if the party refuſe to take this oath thus tendered to him, then is he by the Law lyable to <hi>cenſure and puniſhment</hi> for it: and I conceive it is not thought fit, that ſuch a perſon, be he a Recuſant of what kind ſoever, ſhould plead this Statute, that this Oath ſhould not be tendered to them.</p>
                     <p>By the Law all Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical Judges, when they give Inſtitution into Benefices, or give licenſe to preach, teach ſchool, ſerve Cures, and in other caſes, are to give to the parties the Oath of Allegeance and supremacy: ſhould theſe parties refuſe to take theſe oaths, it were penal to them.</p>
                     <p>When the Biſhops make their Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Advocates, Regiſters, Proctors, or the Deans and Chapters, their Commiſſaries, Officials, or <hi>Auditores cauſarum,</hi> or the Archdeacons their Officials, or any other Eccleſiaſtical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers whatſoever, the ſame oaths are to be given them: ſhould theſe parties refuſe to take theſe oaths, it were penal to them. So a greater part of the courſe of proceeding in Eccleſiaſtical Courts is taken away, then perhaps many think of.</p>
                     <p>So in the Oath of Calumny and of Malice, to be tendered in the proceedings in eccleſiaſtical Courts; if the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take them, 'tis penal to him. And in many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eaſie to be enumerated, but this may ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>The guiltleſs and innocent have no benefit by taking away this oath, eſpecially that of Purgation; nay, (admitting that which, as above, ſome affirm, That though they offer to take the oath of Purgation, the Eccleſiaſtical Judge is not to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it) in that caſe they are endamaged by it, and cannot make their innocency appear in ſuch a way and means as the Law did afford, and to be reſtored to all intents and purpoſes to their good name and fame, of which they were in a great part (though unjuſtly) bereaved; and might have a good Action againſt any, that after ſuch Purgation defamed them.</p>

                     <p>Many other inconveniences and hurts, that too probably may be feared to ariſe from the prohibition of theſe oaths, in ſuch caſes as before, might upon further conſideration be enumerated: and though in the laſt place, yet even that too, of adding further diſcouragement to the profeſſors of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws, who have not had a few for a long time together, may perhaps deſerve to be thought upon. It is too viſible that there are not a few, that would not have them enjoy ſo much of practice and power, as that without which the State can ſcarce ſpare them, that is in maritime cauſes touching Traffick and commerce with Forreigners; a point eminently conſiderable as to the benefit of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the Law it ſelf, ſurely all Scholers and ingenuous men, of what Robe or Profeſſion ſoever, cannot but honour it for the Antiquity, and in a ſort Univerſality, and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, and the great number of Nations, and ſo many, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100164:143"/>noble, and well-civilized exerciſe, that were anciently, and in great part, and yet are governed by the rules thereof, and the helps received from it even by our own Nation too; many wayes demonſtrable. Before our Saviours time, as is touched before,<note place="margin">Cic. famil. epiſt.</note> in the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Trebatius</hi> an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Civil-Lawyer, and often alledged in the <hi>Pandects,</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Samarobrina</hi> in this Iſland of <hi>Britain;</hi> and after that the Oracle of that Law,<note place="margin">Forcatulus.</note> 
                        <hi>Aemilius Paulus Papinianus,</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Law, and kept his Tribunal ſeat of Praetorſhip in the City of <hi>York:</hi> and no inconſiderable part of the Municipal Laws of our Nation have flowed from that Fountain, and drawn many Rules and Maxims thence. So that it may, as that learned Civilian, Sir <hi>Rob. Wiſeman</hi> Knight, Doctor of the Laws, His Majeſties Advocate general for the Kingdom of <hi>Engl.</hi> in that Treatiſe of his of the Excellency of the Civil Law, be truly ſtyled <hi>The Law of Laws;</hi> and as it was ſaid to that <hi>Roman</hi> orator highly commending eloquence, that he lifted her up to the skies, that he alſo with her might be raiſed up thither; ſo he in that learned and judicious Tract of his, ſetting forth the due and juſt honour and <hi>Encomium</hi> of the Civil Laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be thereby perpetually honoured. And for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Civil Law in this Nation, their ſhare of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in theſe late tempeſtuous times was the earlieſt, began firſt, ſome years before the Loyal Clergy were deſtroyed: For upon the paſſing that Act for the taking away the High Commiſſion, in the tail of it was that ſting, which (as the then more powerful part interpreted it) took away the coercive power from the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and ſo in a manner made them uſeleſs and precarious, if not ridiculous; and within a very few dayes after paſſed that Act for Poll-money, where every Eccleſiaſtical Judge, that had any Eccleſiaſtical Office of Judicature, (though ſome of thoſe places were not worth 30 <hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr> per annum,</hi> nor 20 <hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr> per annum,</hi> and ſome leſs) paid 15 <abbr>
                           <hi>l.</hi>
                        </abbr> a greater ſumme then ſome men paid of 10000 <hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr> per annum,</hi> and more in Land of Inheritance: So ſharp-ſighted was that Act towards that then in a manner even ruined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The reaſon of it was viſible enough, and no wayes diſhonourable to that profeſſion or profeſſors, who acted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100164:143"/>juſtly according to the known Laws of the Land; had they done otherwiſe, ſurely they had not wanted legal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the times then were, and the cry that was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly raiſed againſt them; when the furious flame of Civil war broke forth, that waſted the church, all loyal Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all that had dependance or relation to them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of any Offices or Places, as moſt, if not all, Civilians had then. As to the Civilians, <hi>Sublatum fuit queſtionis ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> their Offices and Places were quite taken away. Indeed the moſt reverend Fathers the Lords Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with Deans, Chapters, Archdeacons, and other Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, taſted of the ſame cup, were <hi>A la mode</hi> then, but not ſo ſoon as the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, root and branch deſtroyed: but the Beneficed Rectors and Vicars that for their Loyalty were thruſt out of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, had a ſmall pittance reſerved them, (though when paid at all, miſerably ſhrunk and leſſened almoſt to nothing) that is, as they called it, the Fifths of their Livings: But as to the reverend Prelates and Dignitaries, and the Civilians, there was nothing left, under ſuch pitiful Step-fathers, were the then nick-named Fathers of their Country, the prevailing party in that Long Parliament, during the time of the long continued uſurping Power, even till His Sacred Majeſties happy Reſtauration; thoſe cauſes and buſineſſes, which of right ought to have been agitated and diſpatched by Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their ſeveral Offices and places, many of them, as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Defamation, Matrimonial cauſes, Tithes, if not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies alſo, and ſeveral other branches of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, were all along diſpatched at Common Law or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, contrary to all Law and equity; Probate of Wills, and granting of Letters of Adminiſtration, with all the connexes and incidents thereunto belonging, and from thence ariſing; were by Commiſſion from that uſurping Power, committed to a few perſons of their own gang at <hi>London,</hi> ſo that the Subjects from all parts of the Kingdom were to prove the Wills of the dead, and take Adminiſtration of Inteſtates Goods, paſſe their Accompts, and act the reſt concerning them, there before them at <hi>London.</hi> The Executors and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100164:144"/>muſt either come up thither perſonally to them, to take their oaths, or elſe have Commiſſions down into their Countries to do it; and the charges to the Subject for ſuch Probate of Wills, Letters of Adminiſtration, and the reſt, whether they went up themſelves to <hi>London</hi> to diſpatch them, or more eſpecially if they ſent up by others thither to have them done, as moſt commonly they did, and not ſcare one in forty did otherwiſe, and it was the cheapeſt way probably for them ſo to do, in regard of the charges, to ſend up by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that alſo had other buſineſs of their own there: Yet, I ſay, by theſe means, and the great Fees taken, the charges for proving every Will, taking Letters of Adminiſtration, and the reſt, came ordinarily to about ſix times (ſometimes much more) as much as was taken and due before theſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom irregular times, by the Eccleſiaſtical Judges and Officers to whom of right they appertained: that is, the Fees and charges uſually came to 50 <abbr>
                           <hi>s.</hi>
                        </abbr> or 3 <abbr>

                        </abbr> or more. Had ſuch a Grievance, and ſo general throughout the Kingdom, reigned in the time of Kingſhip, when faithful and peaceable men acted according to the known Laws of the Land; ſurely the fall of <hi>Nilus</hi> to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dupes</hi> would not have made ſuch a noiſe, as our factious Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would have then bellowed out. And too much of the grievance ſtill remains, ſuch Wills, Inventories, Bonds ſo Adminiſtration, with the dependancies thereupon, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill at <hi>London,</hi> whether the Subject, when they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſee or uſe any of them, or ſue for any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, muſt either perſonally repair or ſend for them, or ſue there: which is well hoped will by this happy Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be remedied, and a courſe taken that they may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into every County whence they came, for the Subjects eaſe, and that they there may ſue upon occaſion, for any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy or other matter concerning them. Should it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at whoſe charge this ſhould be done; the dictate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I humbly conceive, anſwers it; <hi>qui commodum habet, idem &amp; onus habere debet.</hi> And thus for no ſmall number of years our Places, our Livelyhoods, were unjuſtly taken from us, onely for our Loyalty; whileſt others, that did it, gloried
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100164:144"/>in their ſhame, took our bread out of our mouths, and did eat whileſt we faſted and well nigh ſtarved; and yet ſuch is the unſatiableneſſe and unreaſonableneſſe of ſome of our cauſeleſſe perſecutors, that they could well be content we ſhould ſtill continue in the ſame oppreſſed and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And when His Majeſty was happily reſtored, (for which all thanks, praiſe and glory be ever rendred to the God of miracles and mercy) the Civilians, as they were (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touched) the firſt and earlieſt ſufferers, ſo were the laſt (not a ſmall time after the moſt reverend Biſhops, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the reſt of the Loyal Clergy were reſtored) that were re-admitted to their places and Offices; and when that was done, ſtill for a conſiderable time they were but preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and of little uſe or value as before, till the doubt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching coercive power was by Parliament taken away, which was not till the later end of Summer 1661. and then with the <hi>Proviſo</hi> againſt the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation, which not a little diminiſhes theſe Offices, beſides upon reaſons known, the forbearance of the full execution of ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as yet, ſo far as by Law they might execute them, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Some Civilians, who in contemplation of their natural du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of their Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy, ſerved His majeſty in his wars againſt his then rebellious Subjects, thereby loſt all their Fortunes both real and perſonal, that their enemies could find: and certainly never were more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous and rigid ſcrutators, or more rapacious Harpies, that would not let ſcarce any thing paſſe their clutches.
<q>Non fuit Autolyci tam piceata manus.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſuch ſuffering Civilians, both ſo in their Livelyhoods, their <hi>quotidianum,</hi> and their perſons and liberties every often, humbly hoped when a time of re-ſettlement ſhould come, that they ſhould have been looked upon as well as others of the ſame profeſſion, that ſate ſtill, underwent none of theſe dangers or hazards, nor ſuffered perhaps any thing, or but little in their Eſtates or otherwiſe, eſpecially in compariſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100164:145"/>with the others, or as well as others that had ſome competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by reaſon of practice under the uſurped Powers, as to take and execute Offices under them of great benefit, and I had almoſt ſaid that way, if not otherwiſe alſo, immediately act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt His Majeſty and his Authority, contrary to their natural duty, and Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy. To plead before the uſurping Powers, even after the end of the war, it was not, at leaſt for a long time, permitted to thoſe Civilians of the Kings party, eſpecially thoſe that had ſerved him in his wars here. For my own part, though I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfie my Conſcience ſo far, as to plead before any of the uſurped powers, not ſo far to acknowledge their power, though ſome years before His Majeſties happy reſtauration, I was both here and in <hi>Ireland</hi> invited and deſired to do it, yet I would not do it, nor ever did that way or any other give any acknowledgment of their power, or touch any of their Pitch, more then by a forced acquieſcence, and ſitting quiet and ſtill when I was conſtrained ſo to do. Yet, I ſay, I am far from cenſuring any of theſe worthy and learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of either Robe, that did either <hi>agere</hi> or <hi>defendere</hi> before that uſurping power, by way of pleading: I would not be miſ-underſtood, as to be thought ſo much as to think amiſſe of the noble Profeſſion or Profeſſors at Common Law, both which I love and honour, and do very well known, and have heard many of them, ſuitable to their Births, Breedings, and loyal and generous Minds, commiſerate the oppreſſion of the Profeſſion and Profeſſors of the Civil Law, and wiſh that the proceedings in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, by the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation, might continue as it was before that laſt Act that took it away; even for the juſtice of it, as they conceive, as alſo leſt it might ſeem, at leaſtwiſe in ſome mens judgments, to ſavour of a kind of partiality, that theſe Oaths <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation ſhould continue in proceeding at Common Law, and not in the Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Courts, or Courts Chriſtian, as at Common Law by the Laws of the Land they are ſtyled; a Title we like well, and ſurely that Nick-name, ſuitable to ſuch debauched and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſons that gave it, becauſe in theſe Courts their unclean
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100164:145"/>crimes were puniſhed, and that did <hi>commovere bilem;</hi> though they were puniſhed there onely, as before, Medicinally, to acknowledge their crimes, to aske God and the congregation forgiveneſſe, and to take away the evil and ſcandal, and not mulcted or corporally puniſhed by impriſonment or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: I ſay, that Nick-name, ſhould it be given at all to any court, as it ought not, it would rather lean to ſuch courts as inflict corporal puniſhments and mulcts upon ſuch criminous perſons, by Impriſonment, keeping the Baſtard children, whipping, or otherwiſe corporally puniſhing them. I wiſh and hope, that as both the profeſſions of both Robes ſit as ſiſters under one Crown, derive from one and the ſame head, and draw from one and the ſame Fountain; ſo each knowing their certain bounds and limits of Juriſdiction, (which, if not clearly and explicitely ſettled, I wiſh and hope will be) may proceed chriſtianly, charitably and friendly in their ſeveral ſpheres of activity, without claſhing or the leaſt diſſention, to Gods glory, the good of this Church and Srate, and the juſt diſtribution of Juſtice, to the benefit and comfort of all the subjects in His Majeſties Dominions. Let us all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that not long ſince there was a generation of men, then too much in power, that had an equal tooth againſt both the Profeſſions, would gladly have ſeen the deſtruction of both, and made too great a progreſſe in it. The noble Profeſſion and Profeſſors of the common Law, could then expect little more favour then <hi>Polyphemus</hi> promiſed <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> that he ſhould be the laſt that ſhould be devoured. And probably enough ſome of them ſtirred up ſome of the leſſe-conſiderable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyers, and ſuch as favoured their ſide too much, (for in all Profeſſions there is good and bad) to be iuſtrumental in the abolition of the Civil Law; and when that was done, when the out-works were taken in, then to have about with the Fort it ſelf. They have ſhewed their Method: No Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, no King. But concord and peace, it is to be hoped, will duly and indiſſolubly cement there two Profeſſions, if amongſt our ſelves we do not <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> and diſ-joyne the union. Let us never forget St. <hi>Pauls</hi> good counſel and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>All the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100164:146"/>love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi> For the Civilians, if they have many enemies and but few friends, (as was ſaid by one, that 'tis hoped hath no diſaffection to that profeſſion or profeſſors of it, but rather in a juſt reſentment of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſutable to his birth and noble diſpoſition) if ſo, I ſay, they may comfort themſelves in this, that they were put to the teſt in the beginning of the Long Parliament, when their factious Accuſers were ſufficiently numerous and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and had they been found guilty, they had not then eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped puniſhment, ſevere and infamous enough. They could not eaſily have been highlier juſtified then that way, which made it appear to all the world, that that clamorous party, through the ſides of the Civilians, intended to ſtrike at and wound their Superiors, and ſo ſerve turns and ends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe their long-weav'd deſign. If the Civilians do their parts in their Functions, uprightly and diligently, which their own conſciences doubtleſſe will prompt them to, and the vigilancy of their factious Adverſaries over their actions, may ſerve to keep them awake; 'tis to be hoped they will every way find comfort and encouragement: However that peace at the laſt, and the continual Feaſt in the interim, will buoy them up above the greateſt waves of envy or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Good men will be their friends, though the contrary be their enemies: and one <hi>Cato</hi> is better then a <hi>Theatre.</hi> And we cannot but be confident, that we ſhall never have cauſe to ſay, as ſome ſaid in another caſe; <hi>Non nos Resp. ſed defuit nobis Respublica.</hi>

                     <p>Now (as in the Preface) I thought fit to ſubjoyn that little Manuſcript, touching the Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> with that Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination touching the ſame, by that glory of our Church, the late Lord Biſhop <hi>Lancelot Andrews</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100164:147"/>
                     <head>A Manuſcript treating of the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> ſaid to be Doctor <hi>Davenants,</hi> late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarisbury.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat which the Commons Houſe complained of is, that the Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſtical proceed <hi>Ex officio,</hi> that is, (ſay they) without a known Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that they cauſe men to anſwer upon their oath, that which they would have is this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no man ſhould be dealt with, but an Accuſer ſhould ſtand forth, and that no Oath ſhould be miniſtred to a man in his own cauſe.</p>
                     <p>That which your Lordſhips have enjoyned me, is to ſhew my opinion, whether the courſes complained of be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Word of God or no.</p>
                     <p>Two parts there are diſtinctly to be ſpoken to, the one of proceeding without a known Accuſer, the other of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by way of Oath.</p>
                     <p>I begin with them generally at large, and after as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Eccleſiaſtical proceedings.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The end of all Judgments in all Courts, is to remove evil. The Heathen man ſayes, <hi>Intereſt reipublicae ut malefict tollantur:</hi> the health of the civil body conſiſting no leſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving evil perſons, then doth the natural in purging out evil humours. And the very ſame is Gods courſe in his Common-Wealth; ten ſeveral times in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> he repeats it, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſic tolletis malum de medio Iſraëlis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Evil then is to be removed, not onely civil but Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; ſo doth God take expreſs orders, that corrupt Religion, contumacy in diſobeying his Prieſt, Incontinency, Defamation, (matters all of eccleſiaſtical cogniſance) ſhould be removed, expreſly terming every one of them <hi>malum in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raële.</hi> And ſo in the New Teſtament doth the Apoſtle ſpeak of the caſe of Inceſt; <hi>Vos autem auferetis malum de vobis.</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:100164:147"/>Theſe then are evils, and Eccleſiaſtical evils, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If they muſt be removed they muſt be known; for St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Quod ignorat medicina, non curat.</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick both corporal and civil muſt know the peccant humour, before they can purge it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If know it they muſt, by the parties themſelves they ſhall never know it. The firſt that ever did treſpaſs, were not ſo ready to commit ſin, but they were twice as ready to conceal it. And as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith to good purpoſe, <hi>Reliqui omnes congeneres primo:</hi> All other offenders do as the firſt did, ſeek to keep their offence from being known. The offences themſelves, ye know, are called <hi>opera tenebrarum,</hi> and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, that defileth the body as well as the ſpiritual Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is corruption in the Worſhip of God; either of them, we know, is <hi>angularis actio,</hi> and kept from knowledge as much as may be.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Then, if they muſt be known, and will not by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves, ſome other means muſt be uſed to bring them to light; where if there be a party to ſtand up and accuſe, 'tis well, and he not to be refuſed. But we know, and I refer my ſelf to your Lordſhips, that it is holden an odious matter to be an Accuſer, and with the better ſort of men more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Few that be well diſpoſed will be gotten to it, and even they that will, I refer me to your Lordſhips again, whether <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith not true, that <hi>One evil will not be accuſed but out of another evil:</hi> that is, grudge or ſpleen to wreak our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome party, that we conceive hath wronged us; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the faintneſs of men to become Accuſers will make that much evil will not be removed, if this be onely the way to remove it; but God ſaith, <hi>All evil muſt be removed ſo near as may be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. For that cauſe God hath authorized thoſe that hold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial places for the removing of evil, not onely to receive accuſations when they be brought againſt it, but if none be brought to make enquiry after it, in the 13, 17, and 18 of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that by enquiry it may be found, and found it may be removed: Which Enquiry is not left at large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100164:148"/>hand over head, but hath his limitation upon what ground to proceed. Now, if you aske what ground we can have, no better rule for it, then if we follow Gods own proceeding in his judicial courſes; for the judgment is Gods properly, and not Mans; and there is nothing more to be deſired, then that <hi>God would give the King his judgments;</hi> for the judgments of all thoſe that be in place, are then beſt when they are likeſt Gods: the rather for that God, needing not to hold any courſe of Enquiry, becauſe to him all things are clear and manifeſt, not onely then but before they be done, and yet binding himſelf to a certain way in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, no other reaſon is or can be rendred, why he ſhould ſo do, but onely to inſtruct us how to proceed by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In Gods court, true it is, there is an accuſer allowed, even the accuſer of us and our brethren, who (we ſee) is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard and received, though his ſuggeſtions be untrue; as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. But is there no proceeding but upon accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? I take it to be very clear, that it will fall out, divers judgments of his having been given upon another ground.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Adams</hi> caſe no accuſer ſtood forth, what was done was as yet not known, onely he was taken in ſuſpicious manner, flying from God, lurking in a Thicket; which was plainly <hi>species mali,</hi> and God thought it meet to be enquired on: and ſo may we upon like ſuſpicion, though there be no accuſer, even by his Warrant.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Eves</hi> caſe neither had ſhe any accuſer, but by examining <hi>Adam</hi> ſhe came to be impeached <hi>tanquam particeps criminis,</hi> at the leaſt; which, as we know, was by way of detection, which is not properly accuſation, yet ſufficient enough to ground a ſentence upon, as (we ſee) God did, and they that ſit in his place may do the like.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Cains</hi> caſe it fell out clear otherwiſe then in <hi>Adams,</hi> for in <hi>Adams</hi> the fact was unknown, in <hi>Cains</hi> onely the party, for the murther was evident.</p>
                     <p>Now to find out the party, the way which God taketh is by preſumption, for that there had been malice born <hi>Abel</hi> by <hi>Cain,</hi> and he admoniſhed thereof, his very countenance bewraying as much; this did God hold cauſe enough to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100164:148"/>ground an Enquiry upon, and ſo may we. In the caſe of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> there is yet another way; <hi>clamor multus eſt,</hi> ſaith God, there is a great rumour or fame runneth upon <hi>Sodoms</hi> naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>I will go down and enquire of it,</hi> ſaith God in expreſs words. So that whether there be accuſation or no, vehement ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or detection, or ſtrong preſumption, or fame will ſupply the want of an Accuſer; and the Judge even by very duty is authorized to proceed to enquire upon any of theſe.</p>
                     <p>A little to inſiſt on this of fame, whereof our Savour Chriſt in the Goſpel hath made that a branch which we call <hi>denunciatio Evangelica;</hi> when a party of good credit diſcloſeth unto the Judge a fault, but will not ſuſtain either the hazard, trouble or charge of an Accuſer. Yet doth our Saviour Chriſt give warrant to the Church, even in that caſe to call the party, and take order with him. But this point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon fame, hath not onely warrant of proceeding in Gods example, but in his expreſs charge; two ſeveral places of the Law where the ground is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.4. <hi>If it be told thee that ſuch or ſuch a fault is done,</hi> the proceeding is <hi>perſcrutando &amp; interrogando. Perſcrutando,</hi> that is, by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evidence; <hi>Interrogando,</hi> that is, by interrogating the party about the fault ſuggeſted. And we ſee plainly in a caſe of Eccleſiaſtical correction for matter of Inceſt, the Apoſtle goeth no further, but layeth this for his ground, <hi>There goeth a report, that ſuch a party there is among you.</hi> As therefore when an accuſer offereth himſelf, he is not to be rejected; ſo though none do, rather then faults ſhould go uncenſurable, the Judge even of very duty is to ſearch them out: In his ſearch not proceeding without ſome of theſe that have been mentioned, but with theſe he hath good warrant, even as good as Gods own example and commandment.</p>
                     <p>Sufficient hath been ſaid to ſhew, that without an Accuſer a Judge may proceed by enquiry to interrogate a party, but whether upon his <hi>Oath,</hi> that is the ſecond point to be ſhewed, no leſs warrantable by the Word of God then the former.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of the Woman ſuſpected to have made a fault to her husband, and that upon no other ground, but upon her husbands own jealouſie; the Eccleſiaſtical Judge was not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100164:149"/>onely authorized to examine her concerning it, and then to reſt on her denyal; but alſo to put her to her oath, and make her to abjure it with execration, as it is plainly, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. And it is a caſe of a ſin againſt the ſeventh Commandment.</p>
                     <p>In a ſin againſt the eighth Commandment, betwixt man and man: <hi>If one had committed ought to anothers truſt,</hi> and were perſwaded that he had played falſe with him, he might bring him before the Judge, and have the matter ſearched into, and at the Plaintiffs inſtance the Judge was to lay an oath upon him, and the other not to refuſe it. And of this there are more caſes then one, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. And if in private cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man this manner of proceeding be allowed, it will follow <hi>à fortiori,</hi> if for the private benefit, much more that which God granteth to a private man, it is to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he will not deny to a Magiſtrate: that which to ſatisfie one party he licenſeth, he will likewiſe think meet to licenſe for the taking away of offence, and giving ſatisfaction unto many. And the chaſtity of a mans Wife ſhall never be more precious to him, then the keeping of his own Spouſe the Church, free from the like ſtains of pollution.</p>
                     <p>In a ſin againſt the ſixth Commandment, a caſe of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one is found ſlain; no man can be accuſed or ſuſpected for doing it: In this caſe the Governors of the next City to the body ſo found, are by the Law to come to the place to offer a ſacrifice, to invocate the name of God, and ſolemnly to teſtifie by that Invocation, that they are no wayes privy to the murther. This is the courſe in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but before ever the Law was written, we ſee the very ſame hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by <hi>Joſeph</hi> under the Law of Nature. In a matter of State, in a ſuſpicion of a ſin againſt the fifth Commandment: It pleaſed him to charge his ten Brethren as Spies coming to diſcover the weakneſs of the Land; there was no party to accuſe or to ſay ought againſt them, yet for all that he put them to it <hi>ſub atteſtatione juramenti,</hi> to anſwer, They were no ſuch men.</p>
                     <p>The very like courſe was holden in the ſearch for <hi>Elias;</hi> he was thought to be the cauſe of the long and great drought: The King ſent all over the Land to ſeek for him, and to have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100164:149"/>him apprehended; theſe eſpecially that were thought to be the Profeſſors of the ſame Religion, all denyed him; it would not ſerve the turn, he put them to their oaths, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them not, yet was there none to accuſe them at all. Yet for the good (as it was ſuppoſed) of the State, this courſe was well allowed.</p>
                     <p>So have we Interrogatories adminiſtred, and the parties ſworn to them, in caſes of the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                     <p>And if this may be done in civil cauſes, and be not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in them, we argue that much rather it ought to be allowed the Church in her proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for that both Commonwealth and Church be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move evil, yet work they not both one way; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as it is well known, doth <hi>agere ad poenam;</hi> the Church never ſo, but doth onely <hi>agere ad poenitentiam,</hi> ſeeketh to alter mens minds, from the evil courſes they have entered into, ſeeketh by making them to yield to a voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion themſelves, to take away the ſcandal, whereof they have been a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Now there is great odds between thoſe, and great reaſon more means be allowed thoſe, that ſeek for nothing elſe, but the reformation of the party and his ſouls health; and thoſe that end their proceedings alwayes in the loſs of life, limb or liberty, or living, as doth the Civil.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it is well known the civil power hath many wayes and means to ſift out the truth, though not by this, That the Church (if Accuſations ceaſe) hath none, but this onely. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed therefore moſt proper and peculiar to her, becauſe an oath is the bond of the Soul, and they be the ſole cauſes the Church hath to deal with.</p>
                     <p>The inconvenience is none at all: for admit a party ſhould thereby diſcloſe his offence, yet groweth thereby no damage unto him, in that his repentance onely and reformation is thereby ſought, and wrought, and nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus reaſons the Church, but for her practice taketh her ground to be full and good out of the fifth of <hi>Numbers,</hi> in a caſe of ſuſpected Incontinency, which is meerly Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100164:150"/>And again, out of 1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. in a caſe Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, which is meerly Eccleſiaſtical alſo. In both which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories are miniſtred with oath, the proceeding being by Enquiry, without any Accuſer at all. And that which is to be noted in the caſe in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> they are no wayes forced to it, but deſire to take their oath firſt, and be examined after. Then which there is no caſe more like to the proceeding at this day, againſt which exception is taken.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe ſix it is manifeſt enough how agreeable to the Will of God this proceeding is: But beyond all this is the ſeventh in the fifth of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where it appeareth that God is ſo careful to have all evil removed, as leave is given by him upon a fault committed, the party being unknown, to lay a ſolemn charge, and to bind it with a curſe, and that at large, to take hold of any that were privy to the fault done, and did not come and reveal it.</p>
                     <p>Which courſe was clearly of the nature of an Oath, as doth plainly appear by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. where it is ſaid four ſeveral times, that <hi>Saul</hi> bound all the people with an oath, not to taſte of any thing till the Sun went down, that they might purſue their enemies without any intermiſſion: Which oath is judged by the Expoſitors to have been nothing elſe but the publick denouncing of a curſe, or adjuring them in the name of god nor to do it, ſeeing it is held a thing impoſſible, that he ſhould call ſo many thouſands in particular, to take every man an oath, the time being ſo ſhort, and he in ſuch haſte to purſue the Enemy. But it is a thing, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, not unuſual, either before Chriſt or ſince, in the time of the Primitive Church, to make ſuch adjurations, whereby the Church ever thought, <hi>quod poena commiſſi revolvitur in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcium,</hi> that he that concealed was ſubject to as great a curſe as he that committed it.</p>
                     <p>By all which it is evident, that ſuch proceeding by oath may be, and is not unlawful.</p>
                     <p>This, as before, is by ſome ſaid to be Dr. <hi>Davenants,</hi> late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> and others ſay it was the late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſters,</hi> that moſt learned and pious Biſhop,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100164:150"/>Dr. <hi>Lancelot Andrews.</hi> Whoſe ſoever it was, it ſeems it was to give ſatisfaction to the Lords of the Council touching ſuch proceedings <hi>Ex officio,</hi> and upon oath; and 'tis to be believed it gave them ſatisfaction, the Law ſo long after continuing the ſame, and no wayes altered.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>TOuching the queſtioning of parties guilty or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants by the Religion of an Oath, as alſo of ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties taking ſuch Oath, or lawfully declining it; of late hath a Queſtion aroſe, <hi>Whether by Gods Law it be lawful for the Magiſtrate to require oath of the party</hi> (that is, the party guilty or defendant) <hi>and in what caſe, and how far it is lawful?</hi> This queſtion, to prevent any confuſion upon your memory or my own, I will divide into five branches; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this ſhort two dayes ſpace I have not bethought my ſelf of a more diſtinct method.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether it be lawful to exact or require an oath?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whether it be lawful for the Magiſtrate to do it?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whether from the guilty (or defendant) party?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whether it be lawful in every cauſe, or not in capital cauſes, but ſuch as receive a milder puniſhment?</p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100164:151"/>
                     <p n="5">5. How far this is lawful, and in what caſes?</p>
                     <p>Of which queſtions the firſt three have nothing of queſtion in them, if we be found in Divinity; therefore I ſhall in few words diſpatch them.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, it is a ſacred right that ſuch an oath may be lawfully required: In which matter I think it is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveful (as Chriſt did in the caſe of Divorcement) firſt of all to enquire what every thing was in the beginning: in the revolution of time many things are changed; the beginning is the moſt certain rule. Therefore I aske where and when the firſt mention of an oath is made in Scriptures? I finde <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. <hi>Abraham</hi> forcing his ſervant to take an oath, in theſe words, and with this ceremony; <hi>Put thy hand under my Thigh, and I will make thee ſwear, that thou ſhalt take a wife for my ſon, of my Kindred.</hi> So the firſt oath mentioned in Scripture, is here expreſſed: and as it is the moſt ancient and firſt, ſo it is the moſt frequent and onely mention almoſt of ſuch a thing. This very term (to <hi>Swear</hi>) you will ſcarce any where find it in the Old Teſtament, but either under the word <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phil,</hi> that is the Imperative, commanding conjugation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of him that gives the oath: or under the word <hi>Niphal,</hi> that is the paſſive ſuffering conjugation, in reſpect of him that takes the oath. And under the ſame rule are the <hi>Greeks,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom <hi>Orcos</hi> is the name of the oath, which almoſt ſolely the holy Ghoſt acknowledges in the New Teſtament. In that word is a kind of ſtraitning neceſſity, and as they ſay, an exigengy no leſs then there is in the word <hi>Orcos;</hi> for from the ſame word comes both, that is of <hi>ſtraitning.</hi> Thereupon comes that common Proverb, <hi>War and Oaths are voluntary evils;</hi> and that they may be good, they ought to be <hi>preſſed and expreſſed</hi> (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of Oaths ſayes wittily) <hi>either by the Authority of him that gives the oath, or at leaſtwiſe by the hardneſs of his heart that believes not</hi> So that it is a ſin ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſwear or to make war, except it be at leaſt in ſome manner exacted, and upon ſome and no light cauſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it may be required, or rather that it ought to be, the very force of Nature, the very force of the term it ſelf evinceth it.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100164:151"/>
                     <p>But whether from the Magiſtrate? (this is the ſecond branch.) Yes ſurely from the Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>So the Divines of old; <hi>Not onely every body but every ſoul is to be ſubject to the Powers, Rom.</hi> 13.1. Therefore the Powers have power to commit the body to cuſtody, by impriſoning it, leſt it eſcape: And ſo likewiſe the ſoul, to commit that to cuſtody, by laying an oath upon it, leſt it ſhould have any ſubterfuge, by which name God himſelf hath moſt fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Oath, the <hi>Bond or priſon of the ſoul, Num.</hi> 30.13. by which the ſoul may as it were be tyed up; and being ſo tyed up, may be bound to anſwer appoſitely and readily. But yet it comes nearer: If it be lawful for the Maſter to force his ſervant to take an oath, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Abraham</hi> did; if a father to his ſon, as <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 47.29. if a brother to a brother, as the ſame <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 25.33. By how much better right is it lawful for the Magiſtrate to do it to his Subject, whoſe command is more excellent then any other command? I adde alſo about the right ſettling in marriage of a ſon, if that be lawful, as <hi>Abraham</hi> to his ſervant; of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a fitting place of burial, as to <hi>Joſeph;</hi> of paſſing away the right of Birth-right, as <hi>Eſau;</hi> and in private cauſes, I adde alſo of the leaſt concernment, if compared with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: Then ſurely by better righr may the Magiſtrate do it, in the common cauſe of the Commonwealth, whoſe Intereſt is greater then any other Intereſt. And that is provided for by Gods Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8. in expreſs terms; in the caſe of a Pawn, ſaith God, <hi>let them come before the Magiſtrate:</hi> In which place the Magiſtrates are named by the name of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not by any name, but by that very name which is taken from the force of an oath: as though he ſhould ſay, Let them come before the Oath-givers, or thoſe who (when they give the Law in Gods ſtead) in his Judgment and in his Name may require his Oath to be taken: That is, Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. in Gods judgment: 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.8. the Oath of God: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.2. therefore to the Magiſtrate. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Magiſtrate, I ſay, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil. Before him that is the Eccleſiaſtical Judge by Law, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is commanded to purge her ſelf in a caſe of ſuſpicion of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100164:152"/>breach of Wedlock bond, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.19. Before him that is the Temporal Judge by law, the man is commanded to purge himſelf in a cauſe of ſuſpicion of breach of Social promiſe or Contract, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.8. The practice whereof we ſee (and the <hi>practice of the Saints is the Interpreter of the Commandments</hi>) of the Eccleſiaſtical Judge in <hi>Ezra,</hi> who required an oath in a Matrimonial cauſe, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.5. Of the Temporal Judge in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who forced an Oath in a cauſe of Uſury, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.12. Neither hath the pious and religious Magiſtrate onely right to do this, but the Heathen Magiſtrate too, and that to Gods people; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> gave his Oath of Allegeance to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.9. though forced he gave it, and rightly too, if we believe <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and afterwards by a ſacrilegious boldneſs he attempted to break it, he ſcaped not unpuniſhed for it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.13. Laſtly, I adde that this was not lawful to do to their own people onely, but alſo to gueſts and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, living within their Territories, either for trafficking or any other cauſe: In which regard <hi>Joſeph,</hi> now become Vice-Roy of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> impoſes an Oath upon his Brethren in a caſe of Treaſon ſuſpected, though both by Law and by Nature they were <hi>Canaanites, Gen.</hi> 43.3. therefore hence it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that it is lawful to impoſe an Oath, and that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo to the Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>But whether is it lawful to do it to the party, that is, the party guilty or defendant? (the third thing I propounded.) Nor can that be called into queſtion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.8. He to whom the Pawn was concredited is the party guilty or defendant, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.19. The woman ſuſpected by the jealous husband to have wronged his bed, is alſo the party guilty or defendant: but to each of them is this oath to be given, nor is it lawful for them to decline it. In a few words I will ſumme it up: Whether one deceitfully keeps his neighbours goods, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly deteins his friends goods, or reſtores not to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his found goods, when he requires them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.3. or (as it ſeems to me) in any other crime, (for it is mentioned indefinitely, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.31. in <hi>whatſoever he ſhall ſin</hi>) it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Plaintiff or Agent to <hi>impoſe an oath upon the party,</hi> that is the guilty or defendant, or <hi>to lay an oath upon him,</hi> as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100164:152"/>it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe; nor is it lawful for the guilty or defendant party to refuſe it, whether it be impoſed by the Agent or Plaintiff, or by the Magiſtrate. Indeed I cannot deny, but we are fallen into ſuch times, that it may be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to impoſe the oath upon the party, Agent or Plaintiff, and not onely upon the Defendant; for it may happen that they may both prevaricate, that is, the party Agent or Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff by calumniating, and the party guilty or defendant by Tergiverſation. But if we would take the Law from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from the holy Writ, to the party guilty or defendant, 'tis more neceſſary to be given. Examples are thereof: Scarce will you find in the Law an oath laid upon the Agent or Plaintiff, but very often may you find it upon the party guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or defendant: <hi>Moſes</hi> renders the reaſon of it; The actor (who for the moſt part is the party endamaged) he is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with anger, he is wholly wrapt up in the Leaven of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and revenge, ſtruck through with the ſting of malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>will be raſh with his mouth,</hi> which the Wiſeman forbids to be in an oath, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1. therefore the matter of an Oath herein is altogether unfit. But the party guilty or defendant, whom the Law alwayes ſuppoſes to be guilty of the crime charged, till the contrary appear, is much fitter: In him there is leſs prejudice, leſs of affections, beſides perhaps of fear, which is as it were the heart of an oath. Therefore it is lawful to lay it upon the party guilty or defendant, and fitting too to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to the fourth branch; In what cauſe this is fitting: which is more intricate, and hath more queſtion in it. And I ſhall not ſeek any where elſe for the diviſion of theſe cauſes, but in our Law, that is, the Law of <hi>Divines:</hi> there in the holy Law ſome are called wrongs or prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.9. ſome capital cauſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.21. whereof ſome of thoſe being heinous, are puniſhed with loſs of life, life either by being deprived of natural life, or civil, that is, Baniſhment, or (as the holy Writ ſpeaks) <hi>rooting out, Ezra</hi> 7.26. To which are allied <hi>cauſes of bloud,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.12. Lopping off a limb; and there in the ſecond Verſe, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtripes: but theſe others were not ſo great, and were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100164:153"/>partly puniſhed by pecuniary Mulcts, partly by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.26.</p>
                     <p>Was there any place for ſuch an oath to be given, in ſuch crimes as were puniſhed by loſs of life? truly I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to that. Firſt, the practice in Scripture contraries it; for I ſee when <hi>Achans</hi> life was in queſtion, <hi>Joſhua</hi> dealt thus, <hi>Tell me, my ſon, ſwear not to me.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Saul</hi> in the like caſe concerning <hi>Jonathan, Tell me Jonathan,</hi> do not ſwear to me: a willing, not expreſs confeſſion; a ſimple interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not under the bond of an oath. But (which is the hinge of the queſtion) I ſee the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> himſelf interrogated by the King himſelf, <hi>I will aske thee a thing, hide nothing from me:</hi> The Prophet covenants with him, <hi>If I declare it unto thee, will thou not ſurely put me to death?</hi> (nor did <hi>Jeremy</hi> thus cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without the dictate of the holy Ghoſt:) as if in ſuch cauſes God had given an immunity of anſwering, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.14. And indeed Reaſon perſwades the ſame; for indeed ſo ought Inquiſition (as far as it may be) to be made by the Magiſtrate, that the manifeſt loſs of ſouls may be avoided. When as from the mouth of the greateſt Liar that moſt true ſentence proceeded, <hi>Skin after skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life, Job</hi> 2.4. it is to be feared that that, <hi>whatſoever, or all that a man hath,</hi> will comprehend as well the conſcience of an oath, as the fear of God, and what elſe ſoever comes under the notion of Religion, as men are, and as they are diſpoſed. Wherefore, though I define nothing (I know not how) in ſuch cauſes as theſe, in regard of the preſent danger of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet I think 'tis beſt to forbear the impoſing of an Oath. And the Laws which we uſe (at leaſt according to leave or permiſſion) judge the ſame. But in other caſes, being of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer offenſe, and ſo puniſhed more eaſily, I think otherwiſe: Except perhaps we take that ſentence out of the Comick Poet, and place it in Divinity; <hi>An Oath is for the keeping of a thing, not for the loſing of it:</hi> For by that general Law it is provided, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.4. —<hi>If a ſoul ſwear, pronouncing with his lips, to do evil or to do good, whatſoever it is that a man ſhall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him when he knoweth of it, then he ſhall be guilty in one of theſe.</hi> And whereas this cannot be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100164:153"/>underſtood of the <hi>Evil of guilt or of a crime</hi> (as we ſpeak in the Schools) <hi>leſt an Oath, which is a bond of piety, ſhould become a bond of Iniquity:</hi> it follows, it muſt hold in an <hi>evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> in which kind it is neither lawful to refuſe an oath, nor after it is taken to break it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to refuſe it. Solomon</hi> wittingly and prudently laid an oath upon <hi>Shimei,</hi> to the loſs of his liberty, <hi>that he ſhould not go beyond Cedron;</hi> and he lawfully laid this oath on him: and when afterwards <hi>Shimei</hi> (having ſworn not to paſs theſe bounds) yet did it, he loſt his life for it, and juſtly, not onely for paſſing beyond <hi>Cedron,</hi> but for the violation of his oath, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.43. What would you have? even prophane <hi>Shimei</hi> refuſes not an oath, though to the loſs of his liberty. Nor <hi>Micheas,</hi> who by the King was bound up under the Religion of an oath, (neither was that once onely, or that the firſt time, but it had been done ſometimes before) when he was free, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; but being ſworn, refuſed not, but anſwered: though his certain puniſhment was before his eyes, though for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he was to be ſent to priſon, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.16. By which example it appears, as well that it was then the cuſtom in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to take an oath to anſwer, as alſo that the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas</hi> durſt not (perhaps he was ignorant of Gods Law in that point) do as we do now-a-dayes, either covenant that the oath ſhall not entangle us, or endanger our liberty; or if that may not be granted, then to uſe Tergiverſation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Not to break the oath.</hi> That is, (as the principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) if it may lawfully be performed: for except it be ſo, rightly ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, Juſtice breaks unjuſt bonds.</hi> I hope the Magiſtrate ſhall not have leſs power then every one of the vulgar, and every private perſon: every of them have at leaſt that ſmall power. If he be ſworn to his loſs, yet he muſt not change in that he hath promiſed to his neighbour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. and if not his promiſe to his neighbour, then not to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, by a better right ſure, or equal at leaſt. What then? even prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> revoked not his oath, though it was to the loſs of his Inheritance. But that private men, once for all, may know under what Law they are in this caſe, it is not lawful, no not for a King, to do it: <hi>Zedekiah</hi> took an oath to his loſs,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100164:154"/>and as at the firſt view it ſeems, even as well to his own ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as the ſlavery of his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.13. he changed: but God both deteſted and revenged that fact of his. Nor is it lawful for a Commonwealth ſo to change: The Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a League with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and ſwore to it, and this was contrary both to their profit and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique command of God: <hi>Joſhua</hi> (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.15.) thought not fit to have it chang'd, and he thought right: The ſame oath <hi>Saul</hi> afterwards preſumed to change, though he did it in zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet that was expiated, firſt, by the danger of the loſs of his Kingdom, and afterwards by the cutting off his poſterity, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.2. Therefore this is not lawful for a King, a Commonwealth, nor a private man to do. Now I conclude: So be it there be not danger of loſs of life in it, in matters and cauſes, which are puniſhed either by pecuniary Mulcts, or by impriſonment, it is lawful for the Subject to undergo that oath, and for the Magiſtrate to require it. But in this point is much doubting; this Oath, how far it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and in what manner an caſe? Which whileſt I treat of, all my action is (as they call it) the purſuing of the Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, by which it may be known at length, in which way we may go where we may go no further: and hereof I ſee three parts, (as for as concerns our purpoſe) which are thus deſigned in holy Writ, 1. The admiſſion of the ſuit or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call it; that is, the entrance of the cauſe into judgment, out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>receiving an accuſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. The ſecond is the ſtate and poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cauſe, that is, <hi>the foundation of the ſuit or complaint,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> give it the name out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.13. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call it, <hi>the matter to be judged and determined.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> (if I be not deceived) ſayes it is <hi>an end of ſtrife, Heb.</hi> 6.16. The third is, <hi>Inquiſition upon the proofs,</hi> that is, as the <hi>Jews</hi> call it a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation or ſifting of the ſuit or complaint, out of <hi>Iob</hi> 29.16. the <hi>Greeks</hi> call it a Structure of the cauſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a <hi>confirmation, Heb.</hi> 6.16. (for with the fourth, which all men call the Sentence, I have nothing to do.) Therefore theſe three things are to be in all Judiciary proceedings, <hi>That the party ought to be lawfully queſtioned;</hi> after that, <hi>the ſtate of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100164:154"/>cauſe;</hi> then, <hi>the proofs are to be looked into.</hi> And in the firſt part there is no uſe of an oath, that I know or have read of: yet that I ſhould enquire hereof, ſome mens error makes me do it, which error I ſhall leſſen this day, (if it may be done) who think themſelves not ſufficiently accuſed, nay they think they ſhall accuſe themſelves, except an accuſer ſtep forth and ſhew himſelf; and who falſly and raſhly ſuppoſe, and yet they ſuppoſe it, that that oath which is required of them for the ſtating of the cauſe, that is the ſecond part, that is to be required to the firſt part, this is the admiſſion of the ſuit or complaint.</p>
                     <p>So I propoſe it thus: In every ſuit or complaint the matter either is ſo apparent, as that it is manifeſt as well concerning the fact as the perſon: whether the perſon be deprehended in the deed doing, that is, (as they ſay) taken in the manner, as ſhe was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.4. Or ſo with an high hand, or (as we uſe to ſay) with a notorious boldneſs, as attempted before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and all the Congreation, as was <hi>Zimri's</hi> wickedneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.8. In which caſes ſo openly acted there was no need of accuſer or witneſs: or if it be ſo, that the fact is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, but the perſon is unknown; as in the deed body found, but the murtherer is not known, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.1. or the perſon is known, but the fact unknown, as in <hi>Achans</hi> caſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.18. In which matter ſo controverted, a man may, by the judgment of the Divine Law, be called into queſtion four manner of wayes.</p>
                     <p>For either one may be brought forth upon ſome ſigns or preſumptions, as in that firſt piece of Gods juſtice, (which all humane juſtice imitates) it was done againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> without an accuſer, onely upon ſigns and preſumptions, that is, that he fled, and hid himſelf amongſt the Trees, (a ſign of a guilty mind) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. In the ſecond piece of juſtice againſt <hi>Cain,</hi> that likewiſe was upon ſigns and preſumptions, (that is, <hi>Abel</hi> appearing no where) effuſion of bloud being found, <hi>Cains</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or envy towards <hi>Abel</hi> foregoing it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.6.10. This is the firſt manner.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, Or one may be brought forth upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of another, as in that very firſt piece of juſtice;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100164:155"/>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> onely was cited, but he being queſtioned (as uſually it happens) impeaches <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhe likewiſe the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12. and ſo they two hereby were made parties guilty or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</p>
                     <p>The third is, by Fame, or rather Infamy, as for the moſt part ſuſpicion follows in the neck of the facts of wicked men, talk or fame follows the ſuſpicion, and inſinuation or complaint follows the talk or fame: And thus was the courſe againſt the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The cry of the sodomites is great, I will go down now and ſee, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Lord. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner were Inquiſitions made both in the Law, <hi>If it be told thee, and thou haſt heard it, Deut.</hi> 17.4. and in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel againſt the inceſtuous perſon, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.1. <hi>It is reported.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth is by Suggeſtion or Complaint, as in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.11. where the Accuſer of our brethren (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls him) would have made that holy man guilty of Hypocriſie, a falſe crime, yet a crime; and that partly <hi>juridically,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which name amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> they were called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the ſuit or controverſie, Iſaiah</hi> 50.8. (we tranſlate it Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.) And here the puniſhment of the offending party was ſought after, that he might give ſatisfaction to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wronged; partly (as it is called) Evangelically, wherein one is denounced or reported to the Church, where onely the medicine or remedy is ſought after, that the Church may have ſatisfaction in cauſe of ſcandal: In the firſt, the thing it ſelf (as we uſe to ſay) ſpeaks and impeaches the party guilty; in the ſecond, one guilty perſon impeaches another; in the third, the ſpeech of the people is the Accuſer; in the fourth, any one under the proper and true name of an Accuſer.</p>
                     <p>To this I adde a Fifth, but not (as theſe) as an ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to determine the controverſie; but plainly an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary one, not to be put in practice but in the Valley of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> that is, againſt the troublers of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> (for ſo the word <hi>Achor</hi> ſounds) that is, in ſome heinous wickedneſs, or the ſtate of the Church and Kingdom being in danger: in ſuch caſes we run to extraordinary remedies, that is, to <hi>Lots as Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> did, which in certain cauſes is not granted, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7.16. In this <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made uſe onely of his own ſuſpicion, <hi>Are not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100164:155"/>you Spies?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſee the nakedneſs of the Land ye are come, Gen 42 9.</hi> and when they denyed, yet without ſign or token, fame or any Accuſer, he queſtioned them, thruſt <hi>Simeon</hi> into priſon, and forced the reſt to take an oath: Nor did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Law of Nations, or complain that they were uſed contrary to Law and right. For where the peace of the Commonwealth is concerned, that is of ſuch moment, that I doubt not, that God ſuffers his ſpirit of jealouſie to come upon the Magiſtrate, touching the ſafety of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no leſs then he ſuffers the Husband to have his, touching the chaſtity of his Wife, <hi>Num.</hi> 5 14. For the matter in queſtion, it is in a main degree, dangerous, that it ought not to be diſſembled: and the perſons with whom 'tis acted uſe not to bring in any witneſſes, (but ſuch as are guilty themſelves) by whom hey may be convinced. And as to the crime we ſpeak of, it is of that kind of wickedneſſe that leaves no prints, footſteps or marks behind it, by which they may be taken hold of: Wherefore in thoſe caſes it is no leſſe lawful to queſtion or accuſe upon ſuſpicion onely, then it is by the Pillory, Stocks, or<note n="*" place="margin">A puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt the Heathens, where the party was put into a Boat, and another Boat whelm'd over him.</note> Boat, (for ſuch purpoſe theſe things were in Gods<note n="†" place="margin">Jer. 29.26.</note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.) Either of which in other, either controverſies or crimes, no man allowes. Well does <hi>Seneca</hi> (if I remember well) render the reaſon hereof, <hi>Where Villanies run riot beyond meaſure, 'tis unjuſt that juſtice ſhould be tyed to degrees:</hi> to which that plainly extraordinary queſtion of him, who about that wicked extraordinary act of <hi>Achan</hi> betook himſelf to lots, is not very unlike. The God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would have them to be troubled, that go about to trouble the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: and hereof the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> is a perpetual monument. Now, whomſoever the Magiſtrate calls in queſtion by any one of theſe four, (or if it concern the peace of the Commonwealth, or of the Church, the fifth way either) foregoing, the partie is lawfully called. Nor is there any reaſon he ſhould fear, that he ſhould accuſe or bewray himſelf, he is now lawfully accuſed and bewrayed. He is, now that he is accuſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed, to take care how he ſhall lawfully defend himſelf. And hitherto of the right of Accuſation.</p>
                     <p>Now I aſſume the ſecond. The matter being thus before
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100164:156"/>the Judge brought into doubt, the party guilty or defendant, either confeſſes the crime committed, as <hi>Achan</hi> did, and then the Judge hath no more to do but to pronounce ſentence; or (which is moſt commonly done) denies it: which <hi>Solomon</hi> moſt elegantly expreſſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.17. <hi>He that is firſt in his own cauſe ſeemeth juſt, but his neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him.</hi> Now the party guilty or defendant denying, by repelling the objection, and the Agent or Plaintiff affirming his intention: thereon ariſes that contradiction St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. the bounder or end of which contradiction is, that which is every Judicature is ſought for, as there the Apoſtle obſerves; but no bounder will be found, till the matter be put in an equal ballance, except the one party have a better <hi>confirmation</hi> then the other; 'tis the Apoſtles word in the ſame place, therefore 'tis the Judges part to enquire on which part that lyes. 'Tis but a light labour and little praiſe to end ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as are eaſie and plain; but that's the worth of a Judge, to ſift out ſuch cauſes, where the right is obſcure and perplexed: <hi>The cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Iob</hi> 29.16. And to do that dexterouſly and fitly is the honour of a Magiſtrate, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 25.1. to whom himſelf, that ſentence he pronounced, in that moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult cauſe 'twixt the two Harlots, touching the uncertain mother of the ſurviving child, was an high honour, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.27. But before theſe <hi>confirmations,</hi> that is, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the cauſe, ought to be or can be ſet forth, it is neceſſary ſome ſtate of the cauſe muſt be ſettled; or as it were a hinge muſt be, on which the cauſe may be turned, and that firſt of all to be made manifeſt, what and how far he affirms and the other denies, wherein each of the Litigants may rightly call the other, to ſet foot to foot and hand to hand. Sayes the <hi>Iew,</hi> and prudently does he ſay it, <hi>Firſt of all place me the controverſie upon his foundation;</hi> which except you do, (as very aptly ſome ſpeak out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.) the whole Action is but meer vanity, toſſed on this ſide and that ſide, this way and that way, 'twixt the Agent and Defendant: which as we cannot endure here in the Schools, much leſſe ought it to be ſuffered in Judicature, whoſe proceeding thoroughout, ought to be ſolemn and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100164:156"/>ſacred, and the very Juſtice of Juſtice, as it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.20.</p>
                     <p>This ſubject matter to be judged, or ſtate of the cauſe, or (if any would rather call it ſo) the bounder of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, is to be ſought out, either in the behalf of the guilty or defendant party, or of the Agent: Not of the Agent, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he cannot, becauſe oftentimes there is none ſuch, when one is called into queſtion upon preſumption, or elſe upon fame; and when there is, he is almoſt rapt and tranſpoſed, or is driven on, either out of hatred or ſome other oblique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that he himſelf is unſtated; ſo that from him in vain is the ſtate of the cauſe required: Wherefore to the party guilty or defendant is this favour granted, or rather this honor is given, (who is alwayes a perſon certain, and whom the Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts not convicted for guiltleſſe) that he ſhould either by affirming or denying fix to himſelf the ſtate of the cauſe; yea, that by his anſwer onely the ſtate of the whole controverſie may be ſetled, and not onely the ſtate of the controverſie, but (except he be convinced of falſhood by the teſtimony of two witneſſes beyond all exception) an end too of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But that he may not, if he be looſe and free, depart from that ſtate ſo by him ſixed, and afterwards not ſtand to that ſtate, but ſhall recoil and go back from his purpoſe; a <hi>bond,</hi> a <hi>bond of the ſoul</hi> (as God gave it the name) he is to enter into, that is, a religious affirmation, by which his ſoul is as it were bound up with a chain, to ſpeak out the truth holily and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that is, the truth (not that abſolutely, but) as he knows it or believes it; nor muſt go contrary to his conſcience, which we call lying, but even as he were acting with God himſelf, ſo muſt he act with the Magiſtrate, that is Gods Lieutenant, that repreſents him, and requires right.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the people of God proceeded thus, (that is, ſwore to make true anſwer) that practice of <hi>Michaeas</hi> (of which I made mention above) and that, which is much apter, that other in that queſtioning of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.10. evince it; where, when they had expreſly anſwered, <hi>He is not with as,</hi> the King not herewith contented, forced them to an oath, that they had not found him: as if no Law could compell a man, to reſt on the anſwer of a man unſworn. Wherefore as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100164:157"/>it is altogether fit, that the party guilty or defendant ſhould be bound up, leſt he might evade or change the ſtate of the cauſe, and thereupon one ſtate, and then another follows, and indeed ſo there will be no place of conſiſtency or ſettling the cauſe: So he ought to be bound up, not with his bare naked anſwer, or (as others would have it) with a pecuniary Mulct, (theſe are not bonds of the ſoul, which is the Interpreter of Truth) but with that alone, true and onely bond of the ſoul, that is, by an <hi>Oath.</hi> And thus at length the whole hinge of the cauſe being fixed as it ought to be, let us proceed to thoſe Confirmations, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it fitting (as I hear ſome complain) that the guilty or defendant party ſhould be ſo bound up, and the Agent altogether free. Nor is our Law ſo: but as it is not ſafe for the party agent to be ſworn, for the reaſons that I have twice named,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.10.</note> (and God himſelf ſuffers Satan, whom he knows to be a Calumniator, to be alſo an Accuſer) yet the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation is ſo to be put into ſuit or action, and the accuſer is ſo by contract to give ſecurity, under the penalty of a certain pecuniary Mulct, or of a certain note of Infamy, under the price of the <hi>loſs of his time,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 21.19.</note> (as the Law ſpeaks) except he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and prove the ſuggeſtion and accuſation he hath given in: So it is provided for on both ſides; on the one ſide by the Religion of an Oath, on the other ſide by a double Mulct, and no ſimple Infamy; ſo that the Agent cannot calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, nor the party guilty or defendant cannot fly back. Now that firſt of all the guilty or defendant party ſhould be ſworn, and then anſwer, (which ſome cannot away withall) it is juſt and lawful; for if he ſhould do it unſworn, he ſhould do it but in a trifling manner, (that is, being free from the Religion of an Oath) if any clauſe in the action ſhould more cloſely preſſe him, he ſhould refuſe to anſwer, ſhould turn himſelf to and fro, ſeek ſhifts, diverſions and cautels, ſhould anſwer nothing explicitely and home; that which in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Religion he is tyed to do, after he has bound himſelf by oath to do all things holily and clearly, that he had rather be guilty of doing an injury then of Perjury, and would rather ſubject himſelf to loſſe then damnation.</p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100164:157"/>
                     <p>Shall we take a form hereof from the Law and the holy Writ? none ſeems to me fitter for that purpoſe, then that queſtioning of <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the 9. and 10. Chapters of <hi>Ezra,</hi> where the parties guilty or defendant anſwer, but firſt were ſworn: The order and courſe of which judicial proceeding was this; ſome of the principal perſons come, and relate the matter to <hi>Ezra,</hi> of Marriages contracted by many (ſuppoſe an hundred and ten) with ſtrangers, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Ezra</hi> forces thoſe guilty or defendant parties, even many of them not guilty or complained of, to take an oath, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.5. he forces them too in a cauſe, in which they might be convinced by witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but firſt he forces them. After that, as in the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>verſe, Eſdras</hi> with the reſt, to whom the care of that cauſe was delegated, ſit upon the cauſe, which the third Moneth after they bring to effect. Which form being uſed by <hi>Ezra,</hi> a ready Scribe, and skilful in the Law of his God, it may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the deſires of any man not unjuſt, as to the practice of the Law, as they ſpeak) and the knowledge of the rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this is the former uſe of an oath, juſt and lawful, in the ſettling of the foundation of a ſuit or controverſie.</p>
                     <p>The other is, when arguments are uſed to make good the ſnit or controverſie begun. Now the arguments, or theſe Confirmations, to which the Judge gives credit, are partly marks and preſumptions, (ſuch as the nature of the cauſe bears) certain and undoubted, partly in corrupt and ſound teſtimonies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preſumptions</hi> or <hi>marks,</hi> ſuch as are brought forth by the Parents in the caſe of the ſlandered Virgin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,</hi> upon whoſe credit the whole action is confirmed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. In the number of which (I ſay of Teſtimonies) I place an oath, and that <hi>bounder of controverſie,</hi> or (as they ſpeak) that <hi>deciſory oath of controverſie, Heb.</hi> 6.16. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> out of the old Canon make two parts, or rather, if you will, two kinds of an Oath.</p>
                     <p>The former is a ſolemn conteſtation, wherein any call God to witneſſe for want of other witneſſes, who either cannot or will not bear witneſſe, even God they call to witneſſe, who is preſent every where and in all actions, and hath the right
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100164:158"/>of a witneſſe: <hi>The Lord Jehova lives, before whom I ſpeak;</hi> this is a form of conteſtation, <hi>Iudges</hi> 8.19. The later I may call it an Execration, wherein a man gives oath to his conteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or joyning iſſue in the cauſe, as 'tis called) pawning as it were his ſalvation, and renouncing all the hope and help he hath from God, if he bear witneſſe falſly: <hi>So do the Lord to me, and ſo let him adde;</hi> there is a form of Execration, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.44. Neither have Divines thought it of leſſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that the guilty or defendant party was leſſe bound, whether he uſed either of thoſe forms, or both. I adde alſo, whether the Magiſtrate conteſt the guilty or defendant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or by adjuration he be execrated, or he do it to himſelf by taking an oath; for 'tis all one whether this or that be done: whether an oath be laid upon the guilty or defendant party by the Judge, or he lay it upon himſelf. And that they take for granted, as well by <hi>Prov</hi> 29.24. in regard of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as by <hi>Iudges</hi> 17.2. by reaſon of the condition. But this controverſie brings another: I proſecute not that, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that I begun, touching Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Now God hath given power to the Judge to enquire of the Arguments touching the crime, and of citing the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; as alſo to the giving of oaths, and that for the collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>confirmations</hi> of the cauſe. That power is mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt enquire</hi> (ſaith that Lord) and that in general; whereof he ſubjoynes two kinds, the firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſearch,</hi> that is, <hi>preſumptions and arguments.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Thou ſhalt aske,</hi> that is, witneſſes and thoſe that are knowing of the paſſages concerning that cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Arguments. So it was lawful for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſearch his Brethrens ſacks, that he might find the Cup taken away by theft, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.5. So is it lawful for our Magiſtrates to ſearch the hidden corners and ſecreteſt rooms of the houſe, ſo to find out marks or preſumptions of ſuſpected crimes.</p>
                     <p>Teſtimonies. So it is provided by Gods Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If a ſoul hear the voice of ſwearing</hi> (the Chaldee Paraphraſt, a moſt ancient Interpreter of the Law, hath added to it,<note n="*" place="margin">Here ſeems to be ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the printed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note> nor where we have erred; nor is it to be doubted but that it was according to the ſenſe of the ancient church, even before
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100164:158"/>Chriſts time) <hi>made or given by the Judge, and he can be a witneſs of that matter, as one that ſaw it and knew it,</hi> (in which place the Septuagint turns the word <hi>knew it,</hi> into <hi>being conſcious</hi> of it) <hi>if he that is ſo conſcious of it, ſhall be called forth to give his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; if he reveal it not, he ſhall bear his own iniquity.</hi> Therefore 'tis lawful to make inquiſition, and upon oath.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all 'tis lawful to make Inquiſition touching the party guilty or defendant, even amongſt others, though his Brethren, though they be religious perſons; as <hi>Obadiah</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.10. <hi>there is no Nation or Kingdom whither my Lord hath not ſent to ſeek thee, and when they ſaid, He is not there, he took an oath of the Kingdom and Nation, that they found thee not.</hi> And methinks 'tis likely, when this oath was common to the whole Kingdom, it fell alſo upon thoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, whoſe Knees were not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor had their lips kiſſed him, neither did they in this cauſe (though it was to the prejudice of their <hi>Elias,</hi> and that too before wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Magiſtrates) refuſe to give their teſtimony. Neither is it onely lawful to enquire concerning the guilty or defendant party, amongſt others onely; but alſo to enquire of him himſelf, concerning himſelf. The great Judge gave us a precedent herein, in that firſt Inquiſition that ever was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Who told thee that thou waſt naked? haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat?</hi> So the Princes interrogated <hi>Baruch</hi> touching <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> book, <hi>Tell us, how didſt thou write all theſe words at his mouth?</hi> So <hi>Eſdras</hi> the very parties guilty or defendants touching their own fact, <hi>Eſr.</hi> 10.11. So the High Prieſt committed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>to enquire ſomething of him more perfectly, Acts</hi> 23.20. For oftentimes accuſers fall back, (which the Heathen man long ſince obſerved:) All cannot, ſome will not accuſe; what's to be done then? Some mens wickedneſſe, becauſe they are truly the works of darkneſſe, nor can be brought to light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. becauſe <hi>they joyn hand in hand,</hi> nor will diſcover themſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.5. Becauſe the name of <hi>Doeg</hi> is harſh, and even the very thing, <hi>to go forth to accuſe,</hi> is now become poor and odious, a matter of coſt, danger, and infamy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.8. And ſhall we ſuffer wickedneſſe to lye hid and ſpred
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100164:159"/>abroad, and by delay to gather ſtrength, till at length it break out to the ruine of the Commonwealth? and becauſe no man can or will (for it is all one, whether he will not or cannot accuſe) is't not lawful to enquire? ſurely 'tis lawful. But 'tis in vain to enquire without the bond of an Oath. The Holy Ghoſt in the old Teſtament expreſſes it by the word <hi>adjure,</hi> and ſo the King adjured <hi>Micheas.</hi> In the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament alſo by the word <hi>adjure,</hi> ſo the High Prieſt adjured our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.63. and they both made Religion of not anſwering to the Queſtion. Touching the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word there is no queſtion, but that both by the force of the name, and the uſe of it, it imports an Oath. I adde, nor is there of the <hi>Greek</hi> word neither, if <hi>Beza</hi> and the reſt of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, render right that requeſt of the Devil, which is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>I adjure thee that thou torment me not:</hi> that is, aſſure me by giving me an Oath or ſwearing to me, that thou wilt not torment me. So ſeems it to them: but that term of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring I paſſe by. I take the other (if it be another) of <hi>laying an Oath</hi> up on the party guilty or defendant; that is, that by Law it is permitted to the party agent to force him againſt his will to take an oath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.8. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.31. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis more then permitted to the Magiſtrate. Surely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad were the caſe of our affairs, if every private man ſhould have power to require an oath of the party guilty or defendant, and the Magiſtrate ſhould not have power: if in the caſe of a Pawn it ſhould be lawful, and not of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: if one may be forced to ſwear, that he hath not <hi>put his hand to his neighbours goods,</hi> and cannot be forced to his oath, that he hath not put forth his hand to the peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. If, as to the Law, his caſe be better that makes troubles in the church of God, then his that has done it about his friends money. Compare theſe one with another: Firſt, the magiſtrate, then the party agent, one perhaps of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the common people; then the caſe of a mans ſmall ſumme of money, and the caſe of the Commonwealth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that Pawn ſometimes may ſomewhere be diſcovered, but thoſe clandeſtine conſpiracies cannot (unleſs you grant ſuch Inquiſition) for that's vaniſhed into the air, left no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100164:159"/>behind it. Either I am very much miſtaken, or (whether you conſider the perſons or the matter, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the events of the things) the equity and neceſſity of an oath is here greater. Therefore that the party guilty or defendant ſhould be ſo interrogated in his own cauſe, 'tis allowed by Gods Law: and that alſo by the laying on an oath is lawful. And this laſt uſe of an oath is juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not onely that the ſtate of the queſtion may be ſettled by the anſwer of the party guilty or defendant, (as before is laid down) but alſo that the confirmations of the cauſe, that is, the pillars of the proofs may be gathered together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Judge may relye to determine the ſuit on one ſide.</p>
                     <p>This may ſuffice for this purpoſe, unleſs that, as I believe, there reſt one knot or another, not worthy the looſing: but that (as the world goes now-a-adayes) every ſcruple that men make, becomes a rock; they complain, that by theſe means men are compelled to <hi>an infinite oath,</hi> except before hand they may have the Queſtion, and afterwards take the Oath. The reaſon hereof I have given before, and therefore will not here repeat it: This onely I maintain, that the uſual oath given cannot be declined by reaſon of Infinity. for whileſt thoſe bounds, and as it were ends of an oath, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. (which alwayes in Divinity were accounted the bounds, and as it were the ends of an oath) <hi>in truth, juſtice and judgment:</hi> whileſt theſe were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there was caution enough had: nor other ends doth the Scripture acknowledge or require.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In Truth:</hi> that is, truly. That no man be compelled to ſwear contrary to that he knows; as it was charged upon <hi>Micheas,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.16. <hi>Tell me nothing but truth in the name of the Lord.</hi> Or if any man like better that Atteſtation of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo bearing me witneſs in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> This is enough for the firſt part.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>In Juſtice:</hi> that is, juſtly. That nothing be ſworn but what is poſſible: in which caſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant took care, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.5. Perhaps <hi>the woman will not be willing to follow me, &amp;c.</hi> The Heathen themſelves too had that caution, <hi>So far as I know
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100164:160"/>and am able.</hi> And alſo to the honeſty of it; wherein they in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3. made proviſion, that is, <hi>According to the Law.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.3. <hi>Commandeſt thou me to be ſmitten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law?</hi> This is ſufficient for the ſecond part.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>In Judgment:</hi> that is, maturely not raſhly; (for ſo do the Interpreters diſtinguiſh it.) Of which, ſayes <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 5.1. whileſt thou art ſpeaking to God, <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth;</hi> but taking due time to deliberate thereupon, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Theſe are the ends of an oath, which the Scripture acknowledges; nor do they require more, as it is defined, if theſe three ends be kept: 1. <hi>I will speak nothing but truth in the name of the Lord:</hi> 2. Of ſuch things I know and as far as I am able, and according to Law: 3. Taking ſo much time to think on't, that there can be no danger from an infinity or endleſneſſe. Though every petty queſtion is not clear, (which often happens from the occaſion) 'twill be ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to contain within theſe bounds; not to anſwer any thing falſly or raſhly, nor to anſwer concerning ſuch things which he remembers not, or is not bound by Law ot it: that is, he will do that, which without an oath he is bound to do. And he that deſires to be more ſafe then thus, in my judgment rather deſires to arrogate an infinite liberty, then to decline an infinite oath; or he is guilty, or ſomething elſe that I will not ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>And now, whileſt thou art taking care how to avoid a ſin by ſwearing, I think it matters not much, whether before hand thou promiſeſt by a <hi>promiſſory oath</hi> to ſpeak truth, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards thou ſweareſt by an <hi>aſſertory oath,</hi> that that which thou haſt ſpoken is true: It comes to the ſame paſſe before anſwer, by <hi>promiſſory oath</hi> to promiſe to deal truly, or after anſwer by an <hi>aſſertory oath</hi> to atteſt, that thou haſt dealt truly: I have ſaid, and I will ſay: I have done, and I will do: there are two times, but the Oath is the ſame. Wherefore as to the matter I think it matters not much, yet thus far it may, that it much conduces to the managing of ſuits at Law, both that they may be clear and explicite, as alſo readily diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That they may be clear and explicite, leſt (if the party guilty or defendant, being not tyed by the bond of an Oath,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100164:160"/>may ſeem to be at liberty to prevaricate) the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted action may float up and down, and have neither foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nor hinge. That they may be readily diſpatched, leſt (in caſe the party guilty having anſwered, will not ſwear to the truth of his anſwer) the Judge ſhould be compelled of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to iterate the queſtions, and act the ſame thing over and over. It is alſo conſiderable too, becauſe in that form of judgment, which is moſt agreeable to Gods Law,<note place="margin">Era 10.5.</note> and ſutable to this Law of ours which is called into queſtion, this order is obſerved; firſt of the <hi>Oath,</hi> and then of the <hi>queſtion;</hi> and that at their requeſt concerning whom the queſtion is made. For whereas for the diſpatching of controverſies, Gods Law has made accurate proviſion; nor in Scripture is there no ſooner made mention of judgment to be given,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.14.</note> then that it ſhould be done ſpeedily, leſt if it be long in doing it become ſour. Rightly did they require, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.13. that he might not be neceſſitated upon the judgment-ſeat, to give anſwer to all queſtions: It was tedious, not the work of one day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after he had in a ſolemn place given them the oath, they might come afterwards at leaſure, at times appointed, and enquiry might be made into the ſeveral circumſtances of the fact, by virtue of the oath before taken. The ſame practice is uſed now by us, and the ſame cuſtom prevails; which, whether you look upon the advice, is moſt juſt; or the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, it is moſt like the Divine Law. For if the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt go before the Oath, (ſo that it ſhould be unlawful for any to take an oath but in open Court) ſurely one day would ſcarce ſuffice for one cauſe, and the people (contrary to <hi>Jethro's</hi> advice) ſhould ſtand in judgment from morning to the evening.</p>
                     <p>That laſt is, which ſome (doubtleſs for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) would have the Oath ſo given them; that after they had taken the Oath, there ſhould be no farther enquiry: And this they hold, grounding themſelves upon that ſentence of St. <hi>Paul, An Oath is the end of all ſtrife.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> I ſtand not upon it that it may be ſo interpreted, that the original Greek word there <hi>peràs,</hi> rather is the <hi>State</hi> of the controverſie then the <hi>End</hi> of it: But be it ſo, the end; let the Oath be the end,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100164:161"/>but not every Oath, or by whomſoever taken, or howſoever performed (this can ſcarcely be thought to proceed from a man in his right wits) but I hope it muſt be ſuch an Oath, of the credit whereof there may be no contradiction: in caſe the <hi>Contradiction</hi> ought to be ended by that Oath. Wherefore if the Judge muſt end the Suite or Controverſie without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, it muſt be ſo clear, that no man even without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, or after Examination, will or can contradict it. For to deſire to free every Oath of every man from all Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, what is it but to plead for perjury? What elſe is it, but as it were upon warning given, ſo by this kind of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given; to ſollicite men of looſe Conſciences to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this wickedneſſe? For whether the Actor, or Defendent, or Witneſs take it, the Oath is of the ſame Conſcience, of the ſame face, there's an end: if one will ſwear that what he ſues for, or complaines of is his, is true, preſently he carries the Cauſe: But afterwards, it muſt be unlawful to enquire whether he hath ſworn true or no, <hi>Becauſe an Oath is the end of all Controverſie.</hi> If this be granted, it makes well for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured men. Let them make their peace with God as well as they can; from the Law they need fear nothing, nor ſhall be puniſhed by the eare for what they ſinned by their mouth. How juſter is that? Yea truly if the Oath be ſound, let the Inquiſition thereupon be twice, or thrice, or ſeaven times, if it be thought fit, it will alwayes as out of a furnace come forth more clear and pure, and the very Inquſition it ſelf, will become an acquiſition of more credit. But if the Oath be not of good, but doubtful credit or ſuſpected: let it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and let <hi>Juſtice break unjust bonds.</hi> Surely this is reaſon, and is it only reaſon? Doth not the Law ſay the ſame? Whether one contend by oath, either in his own cauſe for himſelf, or in anothers againſt another for himſelf. For himſelf: The woman of ſuſpected chaſtity, when ſhe had upon her oath denyed the adultery, laying a moſt heavy curſe upon her ſelf if ſhe were guilty; was ſhe thereupon preſently diſmiſs'd? (for an Oath is the end of all controverſie:) No, a new queſtion was made, whether ſhe had ſworn truly or no? for proof whereof ſhe was to drink the Bitter waters,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100164:161"/>which would be the confirmers of the Oath if true, and the revengers if falſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.24.</p>
                     <p>Againſt another: When the Law had provided, that out of the mouth of two or three witneſſes, who being ſworn had given teſtimony againſt a man, the matter ſhould be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. Leſt any man ſhould take humane teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for Divine Oracles, in the next Verſe 'tis commanded, that the ſuſpected witneſſe muſt ſtand before the Lord, the Prieſts, and it muſt be enquired into whether he hath carried himſelf ſincerely and truly in the teſtimony he hath given; but if he be convicted of falſity, then ſhall he be puniſhed as he ſhould have been whom he complained of. But I ſhall tranſgreſs upon the time, and upon the Church too, (the Clock having a while ago called us off) if I ſhould further follow theſe trifles, which whoever liſt my bray with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they of their own accord ſo overflow: therefore I reſtore you to your ſelves and conclude.<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.17.</note> If (as the Prophet ſaith) this Judgment, which we uſe, be laid to the Line, and Righteouſneſſe to the Plummet of Gods Word, there ſhall be in thoſe things no ſin. For the Magiſtrate to require, and that from the party guilty or defendant, (eſpecially if the cauſe be not capital, or a cauſe of Bloud) an Oath; and that he may do it ſo far, whether it be that the controverſie may thereby be ſet upon its foundation, whileſt the ſtate of the cauſe is ſought for: or that the truth of the proofs may be made evident, whileſt the queſtion is handled. Nor does the ends of the Oath, or the order, or the examination, offend againſt Divinity, and therefore cannot be declined. They that decline it, firſt they do it out of ignorance of Gods Law: then the example is dangerous, that one may thus for his pleaſure enquire into publick judgments without judgment: if we may call into queſtion the reſt of the affairs of the Kingdom, and the moments of the Commonwealth: laſtly the Law it ſelf if it make not for us. That God Almighty may avert this from us, to whom turning our ſelves let us pray, that he will give us grace to be modeſtly wiſe and ſober in all things, to ſee in our minds how irreligious it is, how unchriſtian to decline the judgments of our Nation: but rather with all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100164:162"/>our endeavour, with all the ſtrength and force of our Wit to maintain them, which maintain the Commonwealth and us all; for next after God and his ſervice moſt true is that ſaying of <hi>Elihu, Judgment and Juſtice maintain all things.</hi>

                     <p>Upon the conſideration moſt eſpecially of what hath been written by Dr. <hi>Coſens,</hi> in that Apology touching the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> and Purgation, and what is ſaid in that ſhort Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, and in the Lord Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> Determination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and of the inconveniences and hurt that probably may be feared to enſue upon the prohibiting that Oath and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, together with the practice ſtill at Common Law in the like caſes, and the reſt that is here ſet forth; as it is hoped that Act may be thought fit to be reviſed and re-examined, and perhaps altered: ſo with the like humility, all that is ſaid or ſhall be ſaid in this Treatiſe, is moſt ſubmiſly tendered to His Sacred Majeſty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this happy Parliament now aſſembled, to be weighed by them, if ſo to their Wiſdoms it ſhall be thought fit; otherwiſe to be as unſaid and retracted, as is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing there, if it be diſſonant to Gods Word, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Prerogative, the Laws of Church or State, or the known Laws of the Land, or the juſt policy and government in Church or State, or againſt Chriſtian charity or brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love.</p>
                     <p>Should any man object, That ſome Civilians deſired that this Act, whereby the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, ſhould paſſe at the end of the receſs of Parliament, the latter end of this laſt Summer, 1661. when many other Acts of great concernment were in agitation, and ſome then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſome ſtayed, ſuppoſed that they will be reſumed and conſidered of at the next meeting of Parliament: that, I ſay, this Act ſhould not ſtay (as ſome would have had it) till that next meeting, but rather paſs now, though with theſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo's</hi> on it. I can ſay no more then this, that <hi>Certa incertis praeferenda;</hi> if they could not have all they would have, yet to have ſomething, that in a manner wanted all, was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prudence: it had perhaps ſavoured of moroſity to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100164:162"/>have done otherwiſe, eſpecially conſidering that thoſe that have long faſted would be glad to eat; though, I hope, theſe that adminiſtred this food to them, did not fear they would (as hungry men uſe to do) feed too faſt, to their hurt, not to their nouriſhment, and therefore did ſet the leſs meat before them; but upon a pauſe after this refreſhment there may be a ſupply: Neither need (I humbly conceive) any thing that is already done, hinder the review or alteration of this Act in that point. For it is no new thing nor diſcommendable, (but contrary) to make Laws upon preſent reaſons or emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and yet upon future accidents or contingencies, and variation of the times and occaſions, and other neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, which could not well be foreſeen at the making of theſe Laws, nor perhaps dreamt on till they happened; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, change or repeal the former.

                     <p>And now that I am ſpeaking of repealing and altering old Laws, and making new, I thought fit to cloſe this Tract with ſome Notes of mine, drawn up almoſt all of them in the time of the uſurped Government, and ſome after His Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, and communicated to the ſight of ſome of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, touching the repealing or altering of ſome old Laws, and making new. Some are already paſt and effected, as that for the Lords the Biſhops ſitting again in the Lords Houſe in Parliament, and other things.

                        <head>Touching Parliaments.</head>
                        <p>AS a Parliament well conſtituted and acting regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Parliament proceedings.</note> conduces much to the happineſſe of King and Subject: ſo any exorbitancy or deviation therein (of which ſurely all unbiaſſed men cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe we have had too much ſad experience in the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) works the contrary: <hi>corruptio optimi peſſima.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the time of the Long Parliament ſome, as it were, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd it, even almoſt to an opinion even of Infallibility, of which they have made too much advantage to the miſery of King and People.</p>
                        <p>Some adviſed then, that that great Wheel, that great Court ſhould have had its ſphere of activity, its known certain bounds publickly declared, and not have been like a great River prodigiouſly overflowing all its banks and bounds.</p>
                        <p>Such a Parliament acting regularly, is't not probable the Members thereof would not ſo much have thirſted to leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, much leſſe to perpetuate it?</p>
                        <p>They were called up to conſult; may not he that calls his Counſellor forbear conſulting him when he pleaſes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe him?</p>
                        <p>The extent of an Ordinance of Parliament,<note place="margin">Ordinance of Parliament.</note> having by ſome been tentor'd then, even almoſt to Infinity, might it not have been preciſely circumſcribed, and the exact definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Ordinance given?</p>
                        <p>As alſo the juſt privileges of Parliament explicitely have been made known,<note place="margin">Privileges of Parliament.</note> that the Subject might not then have ſworn, or promiſed, or proteſted, to have maintained and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them, and yet could not poſſibly know what they were.</p>
                        <p>That due care ſhould have been taken, that they might have been obſerved and kept inviolable on all ſides, neither dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed nor ſcrued too high, and both the Members of the Houſes and the People to have had their juſt rights entire: and for this purpoſe that that Proteſtation then put in by the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100164:166"/>Lords Spiritual the Biſhops,<note place="margin">The Biſhops Proteſtation.</note> with their Petition to have the force removed that kept them from the Lords Houſe, ſhould have been well conſider'd on, and the right of Proteſtation in Parliament declared and maintained, being a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. And whether after a juſt Proteſtation unjuſtly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Members kept out of the Houſe, by force, that ſo proteſted and petitioned, whether the other Members could then have proceeded further in the Houſe?</p>
                        <p>In the late Kings time, in the beginning of his Reign, when the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was impriſoned in the Tower, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his ſons marriage of the Duke of <hi>Lenox's</hi> daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bloud Royal, without the Kings conſent; the Lords would do nothing in their Houſe till he was reſtored, in regard he was committed onely for a miſdemeanour, and neither for Treaſon, Felony, nor breach of peace, in which caſes they then confeſſed, a Member of Parliament in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time might be kept priſoner.<note place="margin">The King none of the three Eſtates.</note> And the Lords Spiritual being one of the three Eſtates, as 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 3. and elſewhere, and the King being none of the three Eſtates, (the contrary whereof hath been falſly held) but the Head, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, being but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and further, the Lords Spiritual being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Eſtates of the Realm, as 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. Some doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of the Eſtates can deſtroy another, and whether that come not near the contradicting that Axiom, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be <hi>Felo de ſe:</hi> whether that concerns not the Lords Temporal and Commons, as well as the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual? As for His late Majeſties aſſent, 'tis known how far the prevalent power in both Houſes then carried that, and other things too, to the miſery of the Kingdom: Who knows not in what condition the King then was? forced to flye by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the tumults from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to remoter places.</p>
                        <p>And as touching that Act of Parliament for their expulſion out of the Lords Houſe, it is not to be forgotten, that when it was firſt brought into the Lords Houſe it was rejected, and ought not to have been brought in again that Seſſion; yet afterwards it was contrary to the order and courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brought in again when a great part of the Lords were
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100164:166"/>abſent, if not upon juſt fears frighted out of the Houſe; and it being ſcarce ſafe for the King to deny them any thing, in that dangerous condition he was then in. As alſo that ſuch Conceſſions or Acts as then, contrary to the Kings free will, were wreſted from the King, were not to be accounted legal, or good, or valid; whereof ſeveral inſtances may be given heretofore of ſuch, and amongſt the reſt one 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the King then yielded to and granted certain Articles, pretended at leaſt to have the form of an Act or Statute of Parliament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to the Laws of the Realm, and his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to which he had aſſented to eſchew the dangers, which by denying the ſame were like to follow: in the ſame Parliament it was repealed in theſe very words following; <hi>It ſeemed good to the ſaid Earls, Barons, and other wiſe men, that ſince the Statute did not proceed of our good will, the ſame be void, and ought not to have the name or ſtrength of a Statute, and therefore by their counſel and aſſent we have decreed the ſaid Statute to be void, &amp;c.</hi> And perhaps it deſerves to be thought of, how far in this caſe that Act of 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. reaches, where it is ſet down, that <hi>the great Charter ſhould be kept in all points, and if any Statute be made to the contrary, it ſhall be holden for none.</hi> And one eſpecial Law in that Charter is, for the preſervation of the rights and liberties of the Church, whereof this of the Lords Spiritual, their liberty of ſitting and voting in the Lords Houſe, is a known ſpecial liberty and privilege, and moſt ancient.</p>
                        <p>If we look back to the Long Parliament,<note place="margin">Proceedings of the Houſe of Commons.</note> was it not fit that that Houſe of Commons ſhould have been juſtly regulated to act no further or otherwiſe, then according to their juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Commiſſion and Summons by which they were called? which Commiſſion or Writ of Summons is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all power in Parliaments, as it is well expreſſed by the Lords and Commons aſſembled at <hi>Oxford, Declaration of the Treaty, p.</hi> 15. What fearful exorbitances have been that way, the more ſad it is to remember, the more care ought to be taken to prevent it for the future. The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in former times being deſired by the Lords Houſe to conſult with them <hi>de arduis regni negotiis,</hi> to which the Lords
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100164:167"/>are called, and the Houſe of Commons remembring their call and commiſſion, <hi>ad conſentiendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hiis quae tunc &amp; ibidem, &amp;c.</hi> as in their Writ of Summons, humbly referred it back to the Lords as matters too high for them. And it may ſeem againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and gravity of Parliaments, or either Houſe, as alſo to the grievance of the Subject, for both or either Houſe, or the Committees of either of them, as in the Long Parliament, to trouble themſelves with matters of very ſmall or inferiour nature, much below them, and in caſes where the Law hath ſufficiently provided remedy, and is ſtill in force to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the proper Judges. Were it in making new Laws thereabouts, that ought to be ſo; but I mean in making or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about the execution of ſuch Laws, which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ordinary Judges thereof, and are uſually executed by them, eſpecially touching inferiour matters, it look'd then in that Long Parliament, as though they would have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all other courts, and made a kind of <hi>Juſtitium</hi> in them, during the time of their Seſſion; ſuch as medling with the appointing of Churchwardens, and ſuch like petty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The late Long Parliament deviated much, eſpecially the pretended Houſe of Commons, then to omit, as being too notoriouſly deplorable, the Iliads of miſeries this poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath thereby undergone, beſides that horrid one of the murther of our late King, of ever bleſſed memory, King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, acted by a pretended Houſe of Commons. Was not that then too frequently practiſed worthy then of reformation? that is, the judiciary power being in the Lords Houſe, and the Commons Houſe having power onely over their own Members in ſome caſes, and not having power ſo much as to give an Oath; yet how often did they then upon ſmall matters, unworthy of their cogniſance, in regard they might have been ſo eaſily remedied by the known ordinary Laws of the Band, and the ordinary competent Judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, call orthodox, conformable and worthy Miniſters, to appear before them from very diſtant remote places, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times near upon 200. miles, for ſetting a rail about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, according to the command of the Ordinary; or matters of ſuch inferiour nature: theſe brought on and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100164:167"/>by Inconformiſts then, to the great miſchief to this Nation, too too much favoured, promoted and proſecuted by the then prevailing power. The Fees and charges were then very high, inſomuch as ſome Miniſters were almoſt, if not altogether, undone, before they could get up thither; and when they came, by reaſon of multiplicity of buſineſſe in the Commons Houſe, they ſtaid there long and upon great charge, paying high Fees ſtill to the Serjeant or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Houſe, whileſt they lay under reſtraint, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes was very long. When a charge after long delay was given in, then they gave their anſwer, after a long ſtay too: Then a Committee of many Members was appointed to examine witneſſes, which was done without oath; then after a long time the cauſe was reported, many of theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not having heard the whole cauſe, but ſome one part, ſome another; yet often concurring at the voting and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe to the houſe of Commons; which was a ſtrange kind of proceeding, to call it no worſe. In the Star-chamber and High-commiſſion none uſed to give ſentence but ſuch as heard all the cauſe, and they uſually excuſed themſelves when they had not heard all the cauſe. Now, when the Houſe of Commods had proceeded thus far upon the matter, yet they had done little or nothing, but vexed and undone a poor and perhaps guiltleſs Miniſter: for they were to tranſmit the cauſe to the Lords Houſe, and there to begin it <hi>de novo,</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the witneſſes again upon oath, which, as before, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe could not do. And here 'tis to be conſidered, whether or no it were not <hi>anceps perjurium,</hi> a dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to witneſſes, that perhaps have ſpoken too largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſworn, will, if but for fear of loſs of Reputation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm upon Oath what they have ſaid without Oath. It is to be feared alſo, ſome poor men foreſeeing this unevitable courſe of undoing them, have either wronged their owne cauſe, and betrayed their innocence, by confeſſing themſelves guilty; or, <hi>ad redimendam vexationem,</hi> compounded with their proſecutors, even to their own undoing, or well nigh. If there had been cauſe, and that it could not properly in an ordinary way have been remedied by the proper competent
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100164:168"/>ordinary Judges; why ſhould not the cauſe have been begun, heard and determined in the Lords Houſe at firſt?</p>
                        <p>Could the Houſes, eſpecially the Commons Houſe, then have been brought into ſuch due order, as not to act <hi>extra ſpheram activitatis ſuae,</hi> 'tis well to be hoped they would not, as above, have been deſirous to lengthen or perpetuate that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when they can, as by right, repeal no old, nor make no new Law, nor tax the Subjects eſtate, nor make Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have the force of Laws, without His Majeſties aſſent. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth ſuffered the Houſes of Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for a matter of two years or thereabouts, to continue petitioning him to diſſolve them and diſmiſs them home, which he would not do till he ſaw cauſe. Though this is not in his commendation, yet hereby the juſt power of the King appeared, and the right of his Prerogative, which hath been too long and too much trampled upon. And ſurely the Law in this point is the ſame in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the juſt bounds and limits on all ſides might be preſerved inviolate.</p>

In ſome Counties there being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Corporations, that the County having but two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men to repreſent them, be the County never ſo great; yet every petty Corporation (whereof in many Counties, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the Weſt, there are very many ſuch) hath as many to repreſent it, of equal power in the Commons Houſe, with any other Member of County or City.

                        <p>It hath been ordinarily obſerved as is touched above, that in Committees in that Long-Parliament, ſome have given their Suffrage or Vote Negatively or Affirmatively, upon the cauſe when it was to be reported; though they have not heard the whole cauſe, and ſometimes but a ſmall part of it.</p>
                        <p>Great numerous bodies being ſometimes too ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into parties and factions, as hath been ſeen too often in that Long-Parliament, and ſo conſequently endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heighten their own ſide; have taken hold of, and created all occaſions and advantages that might further it. Oftentimes the Younger tyring and wearying out the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or more incurious Members by long Speeches, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the ſitting of the Houſe long and late in the night, till it was grown thin, and by the departure out of it, of ſo many of the more Aged and leſs ſedulous Members, that the remaining party, according to the deſtined and ſtrongly preoperated deſign, grew prevalent.</p>
                        <p>To inſtance no more (and happy had it been for theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Kingdoms, that it never could have been inſtanced) that fatal great Declaration, or as the late bleſſed King and Martyr called it, the Appeal to the People, hammer'd out that way, by wearying out ſo many of the Members, by ſitting ſo long, even all or the greateſt part of the night, may witneſſe this to all poſterity: Which gave occaſion to ſome to call it a Nocturnal parliament, but very appoſitely did Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard,</hi> one of thoſe ancient Members that was ſo wearied out, when one asked him what he thought of that Vote ſo carried for that Declaration, ſo late in the night, or rather in the next morning? anſwered, that it looked like the verdict of a ſtarved Jury.</p>
                        <p>Many other indirect wayes (to call them no worſe) were uſed by intereſſed parties in that Long Parliament, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their ends, much by ſurpriſes, when too many Members,

Such may not improperly be called Parliament Decoyes, or rather, as in that Long Parliament, when ſome of the Members impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched eleven of their number, upon one of them in the charge againſt him they fixed the <hi>ſtigma</hi> of the <hi>Parliament-driver,</hi> and when it made for them, imputed it to him for a crime.</p>
                        <p>It would be voluminous to reckon up the ſeveral ſpecies of the ſiniſter artifices and gins, which were then dexterouſly us'd in that Long Parliament, to promote unrighteous ends; very often by tumults, which were at the beſt of ſome factious perſons, by clamours and menaces, as it were, to force away ſuch Members as they knew would oppoſe their deſigns. By Petitions too, which were but a kind of Tumults too in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſs, and moſt ſhamefully carried on and gained many times; whether we conſider the inconſiderableneſs of the Petitioners, Oyſter-women, Barbers, School-boyes, (as in ſome Petitions againſt Biſhops) if not others, as much if not more contemptible: or whether we conſider the number of the Petitioners, many ſubſcribing them that knew nothing of the contents of the Petition, if not ſometimes giving power, with a ſtrange implicite faith, to cerrain men of their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſet to their hands to what Petitions ſoever their party ſhould frame; the Petitions perhaps framed in <hi>London,</hi> and never ſent into the Country, but thouſands of hands ſent up in Schedules, to be put to whatſoever the framers ſhould pleaſe; if not alſo, which is much the ſame, ſome Petitions ſent up out of far diſtant remote parts from <hi>London,</hi> with very many

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100164:170"/>not be attempted again.) Some wiſhed this might have been remedied, if thought fit, by fixing a competent time for ſo many hours of the day to ſit in, not to be exceeded but by conſent of the major part of the Houſes, to be conſtituted as hereafter followeth.</p>
                        <p>That no Vote ſhould have been paſſed in either Houſe,<note place="margin">A competent number of Parliament-men to be at every debate.</note> without a matter of two parts of three, or more, (as ſhould be agreed upon) of the Houſe heard the matter fully debated; and that no matter to be debated ſhould be propounded till ſuch a number had been viſibly preſent in the Houſe, which might at the firſt ſight have been eaſily diſcerned, if the ſeats in the Houſe had been ſo particularly diſpoſed, that without telling their particular number by the Clerks, or any other, it might have been known: which might have been eaſily done thus:</p>
                        <p>In the Houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">The manner how it may be conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> each long ſeat in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part thereof, down towards the door, to contain thirty or forty partitions, or more or leſs, as the length of the ſeat will bear, ſo that in each partition there could but one man ſit, and an order made which ſeat ſhould be firſt filled, and which next, and ſo ſucceſſively one after another, and none to go into the ſecond ſeat till the firſt were filled, nor into the third till the ſecond were filled, and ſo to the reſt in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And to make it at the firſt view clear, the number of every partition in order to be in great legible figures ſet over the head of the perſon that ſits in that partition, as 1.2.3.4. &amp;c. then it being known (being made ſo plain and certain) how many perſons each ſeat, when filled, contained, as thirty or forty, &amp;c. each ſeat being to contain equal numbers, if that may be, at leaſt each ſeat of the ſide, ſo many and each at the end, ſo many equally. It is quickly determined, by ſeeing how many ſeats are filled, or how many are in ſuch ſeats: whether the number required to be at the paſſing ſuch vote, be then there or not. The ſeats for Privy Counſellors may, notwithſtanding this, be diſtinct and kept for them, and for Committees ſome ſuch courſe to be taken too, if need were, in a due proportion.</p>
                        <p>In the Lords Houſe ſuch diſtinctions of ſeats and partitions
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100164:171"/>cannot be conveniently ſo done, in regard of the requiſite priority of place there, which is otherwiſe then in the Houſe of Commons; yet the competent number there, (that Houſe being not near ſo numerous as the Commons Houſe) which had need be as many in proportion as the Commons Houſe, might have been quickly and eaſily diſcernable.</p>
                        <p>The number of forty in the Commons Houſe, and a much leſſe in the Lords Houſe, though by many accounted to be a competent number to make up an Houſe; we have ſeen how upon deſign ill uſe was made of it in the Long Parliament, which could not eaſily (perhaps not at all) have been done with ſo great a number. To inſtance no more, the pitiful number of Peers preſent at the paſſing that pretended Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the late Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> death, may be thought on.</p>

                        <p>WE have ſeen in that Long Parliament what ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were made by ſome men of Precedents in foregoing Parliaments, accounting what has been once done there, <hi>quo jure, qua injuria,</hi> right and good, and to be deduced into practice; even thoſe ſtrange irregular acts in the tumultuous times of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: nay, we have ſeen how <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> Treaſon, diſtinguiſhing the perſon and office of the King, ſo declared to be Treaſon by Act of Parliament many ages ſince, even urged for right; to inſtance no more.</p>

                        <p>And that there ſhould in thoſe paſt (and due care be had for the ſame in the future) have been a ſpecification made of the crimes and offences intended there to have been pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and put into oblivion, leſt otherwiſe implicitely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly they might have been taken not to be crimes, and Loyalty and Fidelity (tacitly at leaſt) accounted crimes, and ſo creep into precedent and example for the future.</p>

Not long after the Chamber-maid, grieving for the loſs of her eſpouſed husband, ſeeing her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants Trunk or Box unlocked, liſt up the Cover, and there ſaw that very Boll, which ſhe very well knew, for which the young man was condemned and ſuffered; ſhe calls up her maſter, who found it to be the ſame Boll, which ſhe, he ſhewing it to her, could not deny; upon this ſhe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, condemned and ſuffered death; and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid fell mad with grief, and dyed: And all this came from this judgment upon the teſtimony of a ſingle witneſſe. Should any object, That this might happen upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of two or more witneſſes: It is poſſible, but not ſo probable; and the ſafe way is to follow the Rule afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                        <p>In the caſe of Treaſon two witneſſes are required, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite: and in other crimes, capital eſpecially when alſo in many caſes that are not capital two witneſſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why might it not be reaſonably expected? though the atrocity of Treaſon is high, yet as to the perſon offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering the puniſhment by loſſe of life is little different.</p>

And we ſee what Pamphlets have been publiſhed by <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> if not by others too, affirming the power of Juries, not as is commonly held, to be onely in matter of fact, but in matter of Law too; and how they have controuled learned Judges in their Verdicts, and obſtinately carried it againſt them: and how the meaning of that Axiom, <hi>Ex facto jus oritur,</hi> hath been extremely rack'd.

Or if there were no Vicaridge endowed, the Biſhops might endow one, nay, and go ſo far as to leave to the Appropriator (which then was that Religious houſe to which it was appropriated, who then thought themſelves as worthy to be kindly uſed, as a man would think our Lay-Impropriators
